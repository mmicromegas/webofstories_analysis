renato.dulbecco

The Italian biologist Renato Dulbecco (1914-2012) had early success isolating a mutant of the polio virus which was used to create a life-saving vaccine.  Later in his career, he initiated the Human Genome Project and was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1975 for furthering our understanding of cancer caused by viruses.

Mi chiamo Renato. Perché mi chiamo Renato? Tante volte si pensa che i nomi vengono dati così a caso, ma questo certo non era il caso, perché prima di me c'era stato un fratellino che, quando aveva 11 mesi, è morto di meningite e naturalmente mia madre era assolutamente distrutta da questo. Poi quando sono venuto io, io in fondo ho rimpiazzato questo fratellino. È per questo che mi han chiamato Renato e questo spiega anche perché mia madre è sempre stata così attaccata a me per tutta la sua vita. Ed era attaccata anche al fratellino morto, perché quando lei è morta, ho visto che nel suo scrittoio, dove teneva le cose privilegiate, c'era una piccola busta con dei capelli biondi, che erano il ricordo del fratellino.
[Q] Anche tu eri biondo?
No, non credo. Credo che fossi scuro sempre, sin dal principio.
[Q] Ma sei rimasto solo o hai avuto degli altri fratelli? O eri solo, figlio unico?
No, no. Io ho avuto una sorella e un fratello.
[Q] Ah, sì?
Sono così insomma... la mia vita perciò è stata influenzata da questa connessione con mia madre. E questo spiega perché, per esempio, sono... ho cominciato ad andare a scuola molto presto, perché quando ero bambino, dai 3 anni, mia madre mi insegnava a scrivere, mi insegnava a leggere, mi insegnava a fare le addizioni... insomma tutto questo, per cui quando io poi ho avuto l'età di 6 anni, dove in Italia è l'età quando si va a scuola, mi hanno messo in terza, perché ero già così avanti e poi questo vantaggio di 2 anni è rimasto per tutta la vita universitaria eccetera.

I was born in Catanzaro, and I was born there because my father was an engineer for the government civil engineering group and was sent... because he was from Imperia, from Porto Maurizio, Liguria... and he was sent to work in Calabria during the rebuilding work after the earthquake that had taken place a few years earlier. And as my father was specialised in building with reinforced concrete, then this was necessary because they wanted to build houses, permanent structures, to resist a new earthquake, you see.  Of course...  In fact, he got married in Calabria. My mother was from Tropea, which is a beautiful little tourist town right on the sea. And so I was born there in Catanzaro, because Catanzaro was the capital of the province and my father had his office there. However, I wasn't there long, because after a year, in 1914, the World War I broke out and my father was sent to Turin to work in a missiles factory. So we were moved to Turin and thus I spent my childhood in Turin, but I don't remember much of this. My only memory is of looking out the window at the shop across the street, where there always people queuing up to buy things, you know, what with everything being measured out. Rationed, precisely. And so these are my memories of Turin. From there we went to Cuneo, because my father was transferred, but only for a short time and then from there to Riviera, in Porto Maurizio, because there was also a government civil engineering group there in Porto Maurizio. And so I grew up in Porto Maurizio and what I remember on the whole about my childhood and youth is Porto Maurizio. I went to school in Porto Maurizio, just as I was saying before, I went in at third form and then once I had finished primary school I went to junior school in Oneglia.
[Q] Oh, yes. 
Oneglia and Porto Maurizio have now been fused into one town, Imperia, but at that time they were two separate towns.
[Q] So there was Oneglia and Porto Maurizio? 
Yes. So there were two kilometres from Oneglia to Porto Maurizio so to get to school I had to take a means of transport. At the beginning, I remember that this was horse-drawn.
[Q] Oh yes, they were called horse-drawn trams. 
Horse-drawn trams. Yes, I liked them a lot and I always used to try to sit at the front to see, to watch how the horses behaved. All this was fine. Nothing particularly amazing happened at junior school. Then of course horse-drawn trams changed to buses and then a tramway was built, so in the end the tram was the most convenient.
[Q] Perhaps the tram was less charming than horses.  Yes, less charming.

Then there was secondary school. I went to a secondary school specialising in classical studies and at that time there were no choices. Again I had to study the curriculum as before. One thing that emerged during this period was that I loved mathematics. Naturally, as my father was an engineer, he constructed and designed at home, did calculations at home and I, in fact, had learned to calculate structures, because it was one thing... it's not too complicated, which is perhaps why mathematics also seemed to be interesting and important. And because of this I always...
[Q] This was during secondary school? 
During secondary school. I always did very well. Secondary school... the image I remember most about secondary school was the philosophy teacher, who was a priest and would sit there on the desk. In front of the desk there were benches and on the first bench in front of the desk there were two girls sitting and this bench did not have anything in front of it, so that when these girls moved a little, this priest would put his hands over his eyes. But it wasn't the fact that he put his hands on his eyes, it was the fact that he placed them in such a way as to be able to see through his fingers.
[Q] Was the priest young then? 
Fairly young.
[Q] Fairly. And did the pupils like the girls? 
Oh, of course, very very much. There were only a few because...
[Q] Yes. 
At that time, there were only two girls to every twenty or so pupils at school. It wasn't a very large class.
[Q] And you were saying that you liked mathematics a lot, did you like mathematics more or philosophy or natural science? 
No, to tell the truth I never liked philosophy.
[Q] No? 
No. Mathematics, physics and natural science, these were the things.  Yes.  So, therefore at the end of secondary school, I had to make a decision about where to go. To university of course. But which university to go to, what to study, etc. And I remember that there was a long period of discussions with my parents, because I was thinking... I would like to go and study physics; my father was supporting me in this direction as he was an engineer and so it was connected. My mother, on the other hand, said no, that I should study medicine because she had an uncle who was a surgeon in Naples and was known to be a very good surgeon. So...
[Q] Do you remember the name of your surgeon uncle? 
No. And this prevailed and so I went to study medicine. And then there was the question of where to go? To Turin or Genoa? Genoa was the closest city and all my friends went to Genoa, but my father wanted me to go to Turin instead, because he had studied there, he studied engineering at the Polytechnic and found it to be very good and thought that Turin would be a more interesting town than Genoa. And so I ended up in Turin. Naturally, as I was 16 years old, my mother was very worried. She was saying, 'This boy is going to live all alone in a city'. So she arranged... we knew two people in Turin, a doctor with his wife who had a building, respectable people, etc. And my mother was very good friends with them. And my mother managed to convince the lady that I would go to live with them, in their house, during the university term. This was how it was for the first month, the first two months, then slowly it was clear that it wasn't possible, because I had many other interests, naturally as a student, etc., and so in the end she reconciled herself to this and returned to Imperia and I... I set myself up in a... I don't know what you call them, a type of house for Augustinian students?
[Q] Oh, what were they Augustinians? 
Yes, the Augustinians in Turin. And I stayed there throughout the university period, except for the last two years, we will see why in a minute. This was an interesting place because there were many friends, acquaintances, people who, for example, came from other parts of Piedmont, whom I got to know... sometimes I went... it was very, very useful for me to be there instead of at the lady's house, you see.

And then there was a lovely thing for me, because there was a piano and I could play the piano. This question of the piano came out when I was a young boy in Imperia, because my mother, I don't know how she was able to listen to opera, I don't know how she would have heard it, but she was fascinated by the opera. And so, when I was a young boy, she suggested that I should learn to play the piano so that in the end I would be able to play operas for her, you see. And this is in fact what happened. I took lessons for a few years and then at the end of this I was able to play operas. In fact, this opera period makes me think of something else that was rather interesting. When I was at secondary school, probably in the first or second year, I discovered that there was a radio... because at that time the radio was somewhat primitive, so they were broadcasting music and I thought, if only I had a radio I would play the music to my mother. And then the interesting thing is that I wanted to know how a radio worked and then I bought a book, where it explained everything very clearly, and I started to build a radio, those crystal set radios...
[Q] Crystal set, yes. I think that all young boys, not only at the start of the 1930s, but also afterwards, because... 
And thus I started with this and this worked and we were able to hear something, etc. but then I said no, I had to go further and then following the instructions of these books that I had, then I set to work with tubes.
[Q] With tubes? 
With three, as they were called, with three or four electrodes, making more complicated circuits, and so I managed to build a really good radio that played really well, which picked up stations from all over the world, to my mother's great satisfaction as she could listen to operas. I mentioned the point about the radio because another interesting thing that there was in Imperia... In Imperia, in Porto Maurizio, in fact, there was a... what do you call it, a meteorological and earthquake station.
[Q] Was it a type of observatory? 
Yes, an observatory, exactly. A very primitive thing, because there was a barometer that showed atmospheric pressure and there was one of these seismographs that were used at that time, that was a long pendulum, there was a very long scale... this pendulum with a metal wire attached at the top and then a large lead mass, to which pens that wrote were attached.
[Q] Did you see the drawing?
No, the earthquake made the drawing. If there was an earthquake, the mass stayed still for a moment, the rest moved and traced the earthquake. All that happened there was that the barometric pressure was recorded every day and then if there were drawings... and all this was sent to Rome every day, to the centre and in fact it was the pharmacist who analysed all this.
[Q] And why the pharmacist? 
Probably the pharmacist because he was the only one with vague knowledge of these things. And my dad knew the pharmacist, and when the pharmacist found out that I was interested in physics and mathematics, he said, 'Send him here to me so he can see what we are doing'. And there I went. The great thing was that he had a little room where he built things and there were cupboards full of spare parts for putting them together and he said to me... he said, 'Do what you like'. So I also started building and it was great to be building again... so it was from here that the seismograph came about, you see. The seismograph was an electronic seismograph, which was much more sensitive than the mechanical one, however it had the disadvantage that, at this time, these electronic tubes were not entirely perfect, all the structures, which I gradually attempted to change, to digress, so if it was working it recorded, but if it was out, there was nothing more to do. I continued to develop this technology until medical school because, when I was at medical school in Turin, at a particular point I became an intern in a hospital, the hospital of the Order of St. Maurice, and there I got to know a particular doctor very well. He was one of the doctors I spoke to a lot, interacted with, he was a cardiologist and so I saw the recordings that he took with the electrocardiogram. So I thought, we can use this method that I was using for the seismograph, to measure the changes in heart volume, because at the basis of this seismograph was a variation of capacity... you know, two plates of metal which come together and which move around, this is the variation of capacity. I was changing the frequency of resonance, and so I was just thinking, that with the heart... of course I cannot place a plate on the heart, but I could place a plate in front of here and think of the heart as the other plate and understand the variations of the heart, of the volume of the heart making the system capacity vary. And in fact, it worked pretty well and so we published it.
[Q] Oh, really? Where, do you remember? 
In a paper. This was my second publication, because the first was that of the seismograph, which was published in a geology paper, as it was the only one, there had never been an electronic seismograph before, so it was a totally avant-garde attempt, you see. Although in the end, we did not achieve great results from it and in addition, the invention for measuring the changes in heart volumes didn't advance much either because there was too much variability, I would have had to work on it for a long time, but I had other things on my mind.

Allora finisce durante... l'università, c'è stato per me un avvenimento di grande... di grandissimo valore ed è stato questo. Dunque, il primo anno sono stato lì, ho preso gli esami per dei corsi, quelli che erano per il primo anno, per cui un corso di biologia, ho fatto gli esami, allora tutti 30 e lode. Il secondo anno quando siamo andati lì, sono stato informato che il professore di anatomia, che si chiamava Giuseppe Levi, il professore di anatomia, che naturalmente insegnava anatomia, ma lui era un biologo che lui aveva... ogni anno prendeva uno o due studenti nel laboratorio per fare lavori, per sperimentare in biologia e allora io ho chiesto se potevo entrare in questo gruppo. Siccome avevo fatto molto bene negli esami, il professor Levi mi ha accettato e così sono entrato a far parte di questo gruppo e con me, dello stesso anno, è entrata anche, Rita Levi Montalcini, che eravamo insieme e lavoravamo insieme nella stessa stanza su campi diversi, facevamo cose diverse perché lei si interessava allo sviluppo dell'embrione e questo è poi come è riuscita a scoprire il fattore di crescita del sistema nervoso, mentre invece io ero più interessato a cose che avevano a che fare coi geni, sebbene dei geni non se ne parlasse allora, ma insomma l'idea era quella, come avviene che c'è un'espressione che la cellula cambia e le cellule sono diverse, insomma. E cercavo di fare del mio meglio per fare qualcosa.
Ora la cosa importante, più che quello che facevo lì, era il fatto che ci fosse questo maestro, che era Giuseppe Levi, che era veramente un grande maestro, perché lui era sempre al corrente di quello che facevamo. Lui non ci diceva che cosa fare, lasciava a noi la scelta e poi magari la criticava o faceva dei commenti sulla scelta. Se lui credeva che la scelta fosse cattiva, ce lo diceva, se era buona, ce lo diceva. Se avevamo dei risultati, andavamo da lui a dirglielo e lui allora voleva subito controllare, vedere tutto quello che era fatto, per cui tante volte riconosceva che c'erano degli errori e allora ce lo diceva, dice, 'Questo no'. Se invece vedeva che tutto andava bene, ci incoraggiava ad andare avanti. Insomma, è stata per me una cosa fantastica, perché l'influenza di Levi mi ha fatto capire com'è che si fa la ricerca scientifica, cioè libertà d'azione, sei indipendente, fai quello che pensi si debba fare, il controllo è solo un controllo di riflesso, cioè ti dicono... Ma questo è molto bravo, molto bene, vai avanti oppure dice, 'Guarda questo forse non è bene' ecc., 'E queste cose lì', tutto lì. È questo che ha portato... da lì sono venuti fuori tre Premi Nobel: Rita Levi Montalcini, Salvador Luria, che era un anno davanti a noi, e io in campi completamente diversi.
[Q] Ma direi che in linea chi e stato il primo Salvador Luria, poi tu e poi la Rita? 
Sì, poi io e poi Rita.
[Q] Si può dire che un personaggio come Levi ha capito lo stimolo della creatività inventiva, perché vi ha stimolato in questo modo, cosa che dovrebbero fare veramente i grandi maestri. 
E questo noi lo abbiamo imparato perché con Luria, quando io poi per esempio sono andato negli Stati Uniti, sono andato a lavorare con Luria e lì Luria mi ha trattato esattamente come Levi mi trattava e questo è stato molto bello, bello, ecc. Insomma anche noi... io ho avuto molti studenti nel mio campo e difatti 5 dei miei studenti hanno preso il Premio Nobel. Un bel numero... Studenti o perlomeno persone che son venute a lavorare con me...
[Q] Poi ci dirai chi sono stati questi Premi Nobel?
Sì, certo, questo è facile. Dunque, perciò, questa qui era veramente la parte più importante per me, per la mia vita universitaria.

Naturalmente, durante l'università ho dovuto studiare, ho dovuto fare ricerca anche fuori del laboratorio di Levi, perché dovevo fare la tesi per prendere la laurea. E la tesi avevo deciso di farla non in anatomia normale, ma in anatomia patologica, perché l'anatomia patologica riflette le malattie, mentre l'anatomia normale insomma è la base ma... e questo perciò sono andato a diventare interno in questo istituto di anatomia patologica a Torino e ho lavorato... la mia tesi è stata su alterazioni del parenchima epatico nelle malattie come la cirrosi epatica, l'ostruzione del coledoco, insomma tutte queste condizioni. Quello che è venuto fuori veramente è stato molto interessante, cioè per esempio guardando quando c'è una forma degenerativa, molto spesso queste forme degenerative, che spesso venivano attribuite all'alcolismo, ma adesso sappiamo che non lo sono, non è l'alcolismo, il più delle volte sono virus, e quello che notavo è che... sai la struttura del fegato è fatta... ci sono come delle punte rotonde, dei barili con le cellule che vanno tutte convergendo verso il centro e il sangue dall'intestino viene dal di fuori, attraversa tutto e poi va a finire nella vena che va nella circolazione generale, per cui il fegato filtra, diciamo, tutto. E quello che notavo è che quando c'erano queste forme degenerative, molto spesso la degenerazione avveniva sulla lunghezza di questi barili nel radio, insomma, questo era il percorso del sangue come sembrava, appunto suggeriva che questo era dovuto al fatto che qualche cosa di  tossico fosse nel sangue derivato dall'intestino e questo poi alterasse le cellule e poi le cellule andavano a queste lesioni bivenose, come le chiamavo e infatti, a quel momento, non ha fatto molta impressione questo risultato, ma infatti questo si può benissimo capire che era dovuto appunto al fatto che questo virus proveniva dall'intestino e poi attaccava le cellule e una dopo l'altra il virus continuava a riprodursi ma sempre nella direzione del sangue, perché quella era la direzione del sangue, ma questo è insomma.

So we are now here at the end of university, I'm going to do military service and at the end of normal military service, I return to Turin to start working again in Levi's laboratory.
[Q] So we're a little earlier than 1940, 1937 or thereabouts? 
The war started in 1936, so this is perhaps about 1935. I started working, I was working a little with Rita and then unfortunately the war came and then the war called me forward. I was a medical officer, I was a medical sub-lieutenant and I was assigned to a battalion... regiment that was there in Imperia, which was the 90th Infantry, it was called, of the Cosseria division and I was there several months not doing very much, then afterwards, afterwards... No, in fact, let's stop a minute. Before this I got married in Imperia and after...
[Q] You were married very young! 
No, not really, no... and then when I was there in the army in Sanremo, we had a son... a son Pietro, Piero. So then the war started and I was called up to the army and for a long time I was there doing nothing, there in Sanremo, then we were sent to the French front, but nothing was really happening there, so that only lasted a few days, France was by this point destroyed, for which we were fundamentally there... we then moved on to Mentone, a short distance away and then we returned. And then the serious thing happened when they decided, Mussolini decided to send the soldiers to Russia, to the Russian front, and our regiment was sent there. I remember when we left the station, my son who was about one year old, it was so sad thinking about leaving him there not knowing what would happen, perhaps I would never have seen him again, etc. In short, I remember that it was really sad. Then from there we naturally advanced on the train through Poland...
[Q] What time of the year was this? Do you remember, was it very cold?
No, this was summertime.
[Q] Oh, it was summer.
It was at the end of summer. And then in fact something happened that changed my life, really. It was an accidental episode. This train was crossing Poland, I think it was before it stopped in Warsaw, where I got off, was walking on the pavement back and forth and then it left again, then at a certain point, towards nightfall, it stopped at what was obviously a large station, there were lots of railway tracks, then there were people working there, there were men and women, they were wearing black clothes and had a yellow imprint on their shoulders. I was innocent then, I didn't know anything about what was happening, nothing.
[Q] No one knew anything. 
However, getting down from the train because it had stopped, I knew a little German and there was a worker approaching and I said, 'What are you doing here?' To which he replied, 'We're rebuilding the tracks'. And I said, 'And who are all these people?' 'Oh', he said, 'They are Jews and as soon as they've finished, kaput'.
[Q] That's terrible! 
I remember that I got back onto the train and explained to my colleagues what had happened, what he meant, everyone was... it seemed such an incredible thing that I had never thought about, that such a thing were possible. So from that moment on, I made a decision. I said, 'I'm here as... I am a medical officer, I have to safeguard the health, as far as possible, of my soldiers, I shall continue to do this, but when this is over, if I make it back, I don't want to have any more to do with the army, with soldiers, because I absolutely cannot approve the association of our country with these savages'. And so I spent about nine months in Russia.
[Q] Were these very hard months? 
Well, from the beginning, only because it was hot, every so often there was something on the Don River, which is a very wide river where we were and every so often there was some raid by the Russians, short things with some collision, some casualties. But the serious thing happened when autumn came, because as autumn set in the river froze over, so that the Russians were able to cross the river even with their tanks, because the ice was very thick and so the main attack happened on this river, a point that was...
[Q] So, you found yourself in the heart of battles as well? 
You bet! Likewise I was the medical officer and I was the head of the health service for the regiment, so I wasn't right on the front, I was a hundred or so metres back. Casualties flocked towards me and then I was having to decide if they were slight injuries that could be looked after locally or if they had to go to hospital. And of course many people that I knew arrived, friends with very serious injuries and one said to me, 'Will I ever see my children again?' And I said, 'Listen, I'll send you straight to hospital and they'll operate on you'. Poor fellow, after a day or two he was dead and there were many cases like this. At a certain point Germans came, a German battalion came to reinforce the area and the battalion doctor asked me if he could use our little infirmary, for his soldiers. Sure. And he said, 'We'll see', he said. 'We'll beat the Russians because our commanding officer has the Iron Cross'. Oh well! Everyone returned over the next few days, everyone battered. Poor people.

Only 20% of the people in my division returned, the others went there and I was lucky because, in fact, being a doctor I was already in a privileged position, but I was also lucky because, right in the middle of these tremendous battles with air raids and bombings... I don't know, then everything was icy. I remember that I was out, I don't know, to go and do my business and a bomb fell close by and it threw me to the ground, I dislocated my shoulder and it was also probably a stroke of luck as with my shoulder like this my colleague said to me, 'I'll have to send you to hospital' and so I went and that was the end of my participation...
[Q] Military career...
... of my military participation in hospital. Then I went...
[Q] But you stayed in hospital there?
I stayed for about a month and then they decided that – and my health condition was deteriorating, etc. – that they didn't need people anymore. The Italian component, that which remained, were being sent home and so they sent me home. And then I returned to Imperia and for several months I was in a situation of... I was on leave for medical reasons. Then after six months this expired and that is when I decided I would not return there. So I decided to go and stay in a small village in Piedmont, which is called Sommariva Perno, because some relatives had a farm there and they knew people, you see and so I set myself up there with my wife and children.
[Q] How many children? Did you have two?
Two, I had two.
[Q] You had Pietro, who was the first, and then? And Maria.

And thus another period of my life began, because naturally I wanted to continue to work in Turin and so I worked in Turin. I travelled from Sommariva Perno to Turin, but the transport conditions were non-existent, so I sometimes had to go by bicycle...
[Q] I can imagine. How many kilometres did you have to travel by bicycle, many? 
I don't know, quite a few. I went by bicycle on many occasions, other times I tried to get there in other ways. There was a train to Carmagnola that went to Turin, but to get to Carmagnola I had to take the bus, which left at 5 in the morning from Sommariva Perno, so you can imagine. And then the train was all loaded with livestock, there was no... but in fact... and so I was able to do a little work there in Turin. And there in Turin, speaking with colleagues who knew my position...
[Q] But you were, in this sense... it was official that you had left... you were able to stay in Turin or were you in hiding?
No, I wasn't in hiding.
[Q] Oh, I see, that is important.
So I was in this little village. Basically, it was difficult. I went alone because I wanted to work... no, I wasn't in hiding. And then even worse because when I was in Turin, my friend was there, a colleague at the Department of Pathological Anatomy who was called Mottura, Giacomo Mottura, we were very good friends and then he knew my particular position and we spoke about what I could do, the future and he gave me things to read about political parties, etc. It was necessary to be active and so I became a member of a small party that was called the Christian Workers' Movement, which was obviously left-wing. In essence it was a splinter group of the Communist Party. And with this I therefore got involved in anti-German activity, anti-fascist activity in Turin and I became a member of the Turin Liberation Committee.
[Q] So was this risky too? 
Yes, yes, of course! I remember, for example, two or three times this happened to me: I was at the hospital, naturally in a white coat and, speaking with some friends, some colleagues and there was a man there at the Department of Pathological Anatomy who was organising, keeping everything in order. And he came and said to me, 'Ah, Dr. Dulbecco, there are two men who would like to talk to you'. Then he signalled with his eyes. And I said, 'Okay, okay' and went to where there was a large group of physicians and mingled with them and stayed there all day until they left.
[Q] So, we were saying, very simply you were doing well, because...
I know, I know, certainly. I also remember that this committee that was there, at a certain point we were thinking how it would end up here, because there were partisans all around and the Germans saw that in the end they would not have made it. So they were thinking if only they will shoot, there will be a battle in the city and then we decided to organise a system of first-aid which was based on volunteers, who were organised by other colleagues. I don't know how they found it. Then they were telling me where they were gathered and every so often I would explain some first-aid techniques. In fact, they were all women and it was very moving, because again this was very risky, because if by chance they had found out, they would have been able to take us all. Everything turned out well, luckily. And then naturally the good thing was that the Germans left, without firing a single shot and the only thing that we noticed during the night, because we were there at the hospital, in case it was necessary was the comings and going of armoured vehicles, etc. the noise, not shooting, was only the noise of ironware, you see, this showed that they were leaving. Then in the end, on 25 April, I remember going out, there was new air, the Germans were no longer there, there were no more fascists, the partisans had entered, it was a wonderful feeling.
[Q] Excuse me, remembering this, where were you on the previous 25th of July?  It's not before the 25th...
On the 25th of July?
[Q] When did Mussolini fall for the first time? 
No, this... I was in that area on the 25th of April! Right, that happened later, I still was there,  there was nothing. What I remember was very beautiful. Sommariva Perno was a partisan centre, and I was their physician, you see, and dentist as well... what was very beautiful was to see these young people who were not bad, they didn't hate anyone, they only wanted to fight to eliminate... But, on the other hand, they were very serene, very pleasant, when I went among them, it was always very beautiful. And the same in Turin, there was a spirit of action, of contributing.

[Q] Was it in this period that you meet Rita in Turin, or not? 
No, Rita had fled.
[Q] She was hiding in Florence?
She was hiding in Florence because nobody knew her there and in fact everything went well. And naturally Luria was in the United States, because he went there at the start of the war, so in the end we met up again in Turin and this was another key element in my life. When we were at Levi's institute, where I returned at the end of the war, abandoning politics, which no longer interested me, and it was Levi's institute... and there was me and Rita, we were there, but Luria came during the summer, he came to visit us, because he was here in Italy and he wanted to see his colleagues. I remember that Rita explained to him that I was a talented man, so Luria came to speak to me. He said, 'What are you doing, what do you want to do?', and I told him I was hoping... what I would have liked was to talk about the issue of genes that we don't know what they are, etc. and do this in an original way. And I said, 'I have already enrolled in Physics'.
[Q] So you didn't say this then, you... 
I enrolled in Physics and I did this because I thought that physics could give new means for studying these genes and he said, 'Oh, this is exactly what I am doing' because he had also studied some physics. So he said, 'Why don't you come and work with me?', and I said, 'Sure, I will'. And so I left Italy, I left the Department of...
[Q] And this was in... in 1946, 1947? 
1946. And unfortunately I couldn't... my position was uncertain, it was guaranteed work for a year, post-doc, you understand. So in order to go there I couldn't bring my family with me, because I couldn't have supported them, so my wife and children stayed there...
[Q] In Turin? 
No, they stayed in Imperia and I left. And the coincidence was, I left on a Polish steamboat, that was called Sobieski that was making a stop at Genoa, the Polish steamboat that was going to New York and...
[Q] How many days did it take with the boat? 
A week, and the coincidence was that Rita was also on this boat, because I was going to Indiana, where Luria worked... he was a teacher there and she was going to St. Louis, in Missouri, because she had been offered to go and work there for a while, so we were able to talk and discuss things during the journey, very interesting things.
[Q] There is a story about Rita that people talk about... but it's not true, which was denied, when they say that Rita, the first time she saw you at university, this boy of 16 years, that you were wearing shorts, no? This is a story that is not true. 
It's not true.
[Q] You were already wearing trousers? 
Yes. Of course trousers! I decided that I should wear trousers to university.
[Q] So, the boat? The boat was also a period with Rita... 
No, very pleasant, we discussed the future, you know, what we thought we might do.
[Q] So many hopes after a difficult period.  Yes, with the war. Because Rita had also had her misfortunes.

So I arrived in New York, in the USA and naturally when the ship had crossed the entrance of the port of New York, it passed under the Statue of Liberty... it was truly amazing, a fantastic emotion. Then we got off... then the interesting thing is that the boat arrived at the port, it docked there and after a while the immigration officer came aboard to check all the passengers' papers, so we all lined up one after the other and waited, waited quite a while until it was my turn. My turn came and I showed my papers, etc. The immigration officer studied my papers extensively and spent much more time than with some of other immigrants who were with me. This worried me. I was thinking that perhaps something wasn't right, but in the end he gave me back my papers, wrote something on the passport and said, 'OK, you can go'. So I went down to the pier and headed towards where the luggage was to look for my suitcase. At a certain point, I heard somebody running behind me. Curiosity made me turn round and it was the same person, the immigration officer who came up to me and said, 'Please give me your passport'. Again, I was extremely worried, thinking that I'd have to get back on the boat and they'd take me back. And he crossed out what he had written and replaced it with two figures and said, 'Go'. This was a mystery to me!
Anyhow, I went, a friend of one of my relatives was there to greet me, who was Italian, and who was working in New York, and he was to find a place for me to spend the night because the train would be leaving the following day. So he said to me, 'Look, I'm sorry but all the hotels are full', why they were I don't know – it was the time, in September, the time of the World Series in New York. 'However, I have found a place in this hotel, where there is a Turkish bath', because in a Turkish bath there are a load of little cubicles where people rest after having taken a bath, and he said, 'Go there'. So I went there and found this... the place where there was this hole.
[Q] It was totally Spartan! 
Yes, Spartan, sure. Then I walked around to visit the town which was naturally fascinating, and then I slept there, everything was okay, because at the end of the day I had a place to sleep, I didn't need anything else.

When I was talking about the landing in New York, I forgot something very important, because I referred to the fact that the immigration officer came over to me on the pier and changed the letters on my passport, but what I didn't explain was the significance of this. In fact, when this happened, I didn't understand why and I only understood this afterwards when I arrived at Bloomington and asked people. The significance was very important because when he left me the first time, he thought I was a student and he gave me a student visa, which means that after two years I would have had to leave the country; whereas, instead, having thought about it he realised that I wasn't a student, but I was fundamentally a teacher and so he changed my visa to one that... There are three main categories: one is for teachers, one is for maids and the other- is for priests and clergymen, so these are the three categories. And this was wonderful for me because with this visa I was able to stay in the USA indefinitely.
[Q] This was important. 
Very important. While, with the other visa I would have had to go and I know the mishaps that have occurred, for example, a German doctor who worked with me for many years, Margherita Vogt, well she had this student visa so when her two years were up she had to... She wanted to stay but she had to leave and then apply for another visa. She went to Mexico, then at a certain point there was all this trouble between the two countries. Something wasn't working well and she found herself in the middle of the two customs offices without the right papers, on no man's land, you see? Then in the end, finally, she was cleared. Therefore that...
[Q] This is why I meant. And this permanent visa afterwards allowed you to adopt citizenship which you took on later?
Yes. As soon as I arrived, I could have requested citizenship. I didn't do it straightaway, I did it a little time afterwards. I applied for it when I saw that things were going so well, so in essence, that was the country in which I wanted to continue to work, the working conditions of which I was enjoying and also I liked people's attitudes, as I said before, people were so nice and helpful.

So I took the train to Bloomington, where the university was, and there were people there who were expecting me, everything had been well organised. There was a small room rented for me and then we started to work. And then it was Luria, what are you doing, Luria? Tell me? Explain to me what you are doing? And then he explained to me that his work had for quite some time been focused on a phenomenon that he had discovered. The phenomenon... this happens with viruses that are called bacteriophages, generally 'phages', which means because they multiply in bacteria, and what he found was that if... First of all it has to be said that he was studying the effect of ultraviolet rays, because these as we know can damage DNA, he already knew that it had an effect on genes, and so what he discovered was that if you take a population of UV-irradiated phages, because these phages are all the same, the damage is statistically the same, and they are used to infect bacteria, the effect that is obtained depends on how many phages there are per bacterium. If there is only one phage per bacterium, then very few will survive; if, however, in the same population there are 10 phages per bacterium, the survival is much higher, and then he called this reactivation by multiplicity, because multiplicity is the term used to say how many phages per bacterium. And so he had interpreted these figures in this way, that within the cells, when there are many phages, the genomes of these genes, these phages intersect, so that, if there are damaged genes, these can be eliminated and replaced with good genes, so that in the end, if there are enough good genes to construct a phage, this bacterium will produce phages, otherwise they are not produced. In short, this reactivation therefore gives exchanges, gives crossing points. And so we were speaking about this, when he said that, I suddenly thought... But, how many of these phages can cooperate within the bacterium, the number shall certainly not be infinite. Then I decided to study that, but I didn't tell him, because I was scared that he would object, etc. and in fact I started working on this at night, when he went home.
[Q] Almost in secret. 
And so I was working until midnight there. And what emerged, that in fact there is no infinite number that can cooperate, but a well defined number, above twenty or so, so to go beyond twenty would not be necessary. Thus, under twenty, it is a fact that they cooperate, that they interfere, etc.  so I thought about what would happen in this number. When I had these results, I showed them to Luria and Luria was amazed, because he said, 'This is fantastic work, why didn't you tell me about it?' And I said, 'I was worried that it was a mistake, it was better not to tell you'. And so this was the beginning.
[Q] And did you publish your findings straightaway? 
Yes, I published in Genetics, in fact it was good work. Then, this is the first thing. So, the reactivation, the phenomenon that he discovered, it didn't come into it.

And so, then, continuing to work with these viruses, with these UV-irradiated phages, I discovered another irregularity and this was it: that, when a test is carried out, the quantity of active virus that there is in a sample is measured, this is done with glass plates, where there is one layer of bacteria, and the virus is placed there, this is made uniform and then, if there is a phage, the phage enters the bacterium, produces new phages and so on, so that a propagation centre is formed. And this propagation centre is seen because the bacteria are all destroyed, thus there is the uniform layer of bacteria and then these holes that are called plaques and the plaques measure the number of active phages. So, carrying out some experiments, I noticed something, when... this was a laboratory thing, that when a test was carried out, two plates were always taken, two equal boxes, so as to be sure that there are no errors...
[Q] For the verification. 
And these were always placed one on top of the other, left on the bench in such a way that – because the bacteria were one layer of agar, which was liquid – they were left in such a way that they could solidify and then they were put in the incubator. I noted this that, when I had the irradiated phages, the two plates always had a different number, one had more than the other. If they were not irradiated, it was the same, therefore I said, 'We have to see what this is'. I thought, of course, temperature, one heats up more, cools down more, then I tried to put them at different temperatures, no, it wasn't this. And in the end, looking at the whole picture, looking at the bench, I noticed that there was a big fluorescent light above the plates so this light was illuminating these plates and there was a phenomenon of reactivation of the irradiated bacteria with ultraviolet light, if they were irradiated with this light, you see. So, I said... But perhaps then the phages will also respond to this light and then I immediately carried out the experiment to check. I left some in the light, others not and it became clear that there was the so-called 'photoreactivation' phenomenon of the phages.
Luria was not there at the time, he was in a meeting, and he came back when everything was finished, so I went to him and showed him the data. Poor fellow, he almost died! He didn't think that his phenomenon of reactivation was this type of thing, you see. That it was a trick of the light, etc. So I said, 'Listen, we'll carry out a test, we'll do everything with light, without light', etc. and then it was clear, however, that the two phenomena were separate: photoreactivation was one thing, the other reactivation from multiplicity was another thing so he was satisfied.
[Q] So Luria was also at ease.
And then from there it seemed to me... to understand this phenomenon of reactivation properly, the multiplicity and so I started to carry out experiments with different numbers, under different conditions, etc. Because, you see, if it was true what he was thinking, which is that in order to maintain the activity, the production of phages in a bacterium, it was necessary to have pieces that fit together, restoring the entire phage, when you have done all this, in the end, the sensitivity of this material to UV light becomes the same as that of a single phage, because they are all pieces that must constitute the phage. And this... I carried out experiments precisely of this nature, that ended up determining the final alternation, the final susceptibility to UV light, those that were surviving were much less sensitive to UV light, you see?
[Q] Oh, less sensitive indeed. 
Therefore, this at the time was difficult to interpret, but then in the end... now after a bit you understand what the point was. The point being that UV light damages DNA. The phenomenon of reactivation is to repair the damage that is caused. In order to repair the damage, this needs the activity of certain genes of the phage when these different multiplicities are carried out, what must survive is not all phage, but it is only this gene, this group of genes, in such a way that this then can produce the system that will favour other phages, you see. So it emerged from this that this entire phenomenon of reactivation is also due to a DNA repair. At this time, there were no ideas about DNA defence, so that all this – the combination, the photoreactivation – clearly brought to light that this was the phenomenon of DNA repairment.

And so everything was going well up to this point, I was there two years and the reason that I then left was because a geneticist at Caltech, Max Delbrück, who was a German physicist, who became a biologist. At that time there were many of these physicists who became biologists. And he was at Caltech. He had seen this work and was shocked, it seemed very interesting to him, very pleasing, so he invited me to come and work at Caltech for a few years. I remember that, in this period, in Luria's laboratory, Jim Watson also came as a student and so I spoke to him a lot, about what he would do, etc. And Jim Watson already then had clear ideas about what he wanted to do, yes, yes.
[Q] But he was not yet with Crick. 
No, no. Just his idea. And then I remember, speaking with Jim Watson, I told him about this offer from Max, Max Delbrück, whether to go or not and he said, 'Yes, yes, you definitely must go, this is the best university in the United States for biology work, so you must go, without a doubt'. So I said, 'OK, I'll go'. And so I went, we left... my wife and children were there by this time, they had arrived in the meantime. We had a car that was very old, but it worked, a Pontiac.
[Q] Suitable for your needs.
Yes. And we arrived... we drove across the United States from New York to Pasadena, in California and it was a marvellous journey. So, before anything else, I rented a small trailer where I had everything you needed for camping, including a little tent that I built on the trailer and all that was needed to be able to eat, etc.  Also for the children.
[Q] Were they small then, the children? 
They could manage, they weren't that small.
[Q] Did they have lots of fun? 
They slept in the car and we slept on this... where there were two little beds that I had made. Everything went well, travelling across Mississippi, to the region where Mississippi starts, the Itasca lake and then travelling down. Everything was fine. I remember one morning, one night that we were camped close to a campsite, that there was a bar and it had poured down with rain all night and in the morning, when I got up, I saw that the wheels of the car had sunk into the mud so I went to the bar to ask if someone could help. Four men came straightaway, they got into position and lifted the thing, shifted it and we were able to leave again. The United States at this time was a wonderful country, where you felt like friends, part of the same goal, life, everyone worked, wanted to work-it was a fantastic thing. And then from there, we went down towards California, the last stop I made was in a campsite above San Francisco, on the mountain there and I remember talking to the ranger there, chatting and he said to me, 'Where have you come from, where are you going?' You know, the usual stuff. 'Oh', I said, 'I'm going to Caltech'. And he said, 'Oh, where they split the atom'. That was its reputation, yes. And so we arrived at Caltech.

Dunque il Caltech, arrivo lì, penso di continuare a lavorare coi fagi, che avevo già appunto preso esperienza, conoscevo già abbastanza bene e così ho fatto un po' di lavoro, però non è stato un lavoro molto interessante. Ero un po' giù per questa ragione e Max si vede se ne è accorto, Max Delbrück, ed ha approfittato di un'occasione, che è capitata lì accidentalmente, per cercare di sollevarmi e l'occasione era questa che... Naturalmente Caltech aveva un presidente e aveva un consiglio di amministrazione dove c'erano molte personalità anche locali, e una di queste persone soffriva di herpes e perciò aveva dei momenti in cui si riacutizzava, dolori, ecc, insomma così. E parlando con il presidente, gli dice, 'Ma voi lavorate coi virus, perché non cercate di lavorare con questo virus?' E il presidente dice, 'Ma guardi, quelli che lavoriamo qui, non sono virus degli uomini, sono fagi, virus di batteri'. E lui dice, 'Ma perché non cercare di organizzare, di cominciare a lavorare anche con questi virus umani?' E lui ha messo a disposizione una somma che allora era molto forte, credo fosse qualcosa come 100 mila dollari, e a quell'epoca, sai, erano molti. Evidentemente, il presidente ha dato a Max l'incarico di vedere quello che si poteva fare, perché lui era quello che lavorava lì, e allora Max, mi ricordo un giorno, chiama me e un altro mio collega, Benzer, che supergiù probabilmente un po' più giovane di me. Ma lui, Benzer, era un fisico ed era un biologo molto bravo, e spiegando questa situazione dicendo, 'C'è qualcuno di voi che si vuole mettere in questo campo?' Benzer dice, 'Ah no', dice, 'Io sono un fisico'. Io, invece dico, 'Io sono un medico di partenza, per cui questo mi interessa molto' e così dico, 'Sì, io lo faccio'. E allora mi dicono, 'Bene, come facciamo, come vuole organizzare questo?' E io ci penso e poi dico, 'Io bisogna che veda quello che si sta facendo in questo campo, perciò io devo andare in giro nei laboratori che si conoscono, così, per vedere quello che fanno, per vedere se si può tirare fuori qualche idea interessante da quello'. Allora dice, 'Sì, benissimo' e mi danno il tempo che ci vuole.
E così mi metto in viaggio e sono stato in viaggio per circa tre mesi effettivamente, andando da un'università all'altra, da un ospedale all'altro, parlando coi virologi, coi professori, insomma con tutti quanti. E da questo è venuta fuori questa idea che, per fare progresso nel campo dei virus, umani o animali insomma, questi virus diversi dai fagi, ci voleva un sistema di poter misurare precisamente il numero dei virus attivi, come si faceva coi fagi dei virus attivi, come si faceva coi fagi. Ma questo non c'era questo metodo, perché i metodi usati erano metodi molto primitivi, che davano un'idea generale della quantità, ma non davano nessun indirizzo speciale, nessun numero speciale.
E allora ritorno al Caltech e spiego questa mia idea, scrivo la mia proposta e' questa di... e allora mi hanno approvato e mi metto a lavorare. Così mi sviluppo, metto un laboratorio in ordine per... appunto per questo scopo, tutto basato su colture di tessuti, che io avevo imparato da Levi, perciò questa era una cosa che mi è tornata molto utile, capisci? Specialmente a quell'epoca, perché, a quell'epoca, di colture dei tessuti se ne sapeva pochissimo. Così mi organizzo e parlando a parecchi degli altri ricercatori, avevo visto che c'erano dei metodi per cercare delle colture un po' come quelle dei batteri... erano molto complicate, perché bisognava prendere pezzi di tessuto, pezzi di embrione, per esempio, di topo e metterli in una specie di provetta... al fondo la provetta aveva una rete, non era del tutto vetro, era una rete, per cui c'erano dei buchi...
[Q] Perché, a cosa serviva la rete? 
Appunto, per centrifugare, spingere che... tutti questi pezzetti si rompessero producendo o singole cellule o piccoli numeri di cellule. Poi quello si metteva sulla piastra di vetro per cercare di determinare...
[Q] E tu lavoravi su embrioni di topo allora, prendevi embrioni di topo? 
Sì, al principio erano proprio embrioni di topo. Il virus che ho usato è il virus dell'encefalomielite acuta dei cavalli, equina, perché ho dovuto scegliere un virus che uccidesse le cellule in maniera definitiva, perché volevo sviluppare delle placche come quelle dei fagi, capisci? Insomma, alla fine, tanti tentativi, le cose in principio non andavano bene, poi pian pianino sono migliorate e un bel giorno faccio lì, vado a vedere una di queste piastre, la guardo sotto una luce diversa e vedo tutte le placche. Allora mi ricordo che vado da Delbrück e gli dico, 'Vieni qui, Max', lo porto giù e lui dice, 'Ah, qualcosa funziona. Gli faccio... Guarda questa qui, guarda questa qui'. E lui mi dice, 'Che giorno è?' Non lo so, me lo son dimenticato.
[Q] Ah, che peccato!

Mi ricordo che Max ha detto questo è un risultato molto importante, dobbiamo... c'era una riunione dell'Accademia delle Scienze, dice, 'Andiamo lì e tu presenti i dati in questa riunione'. E così abbiamo fatto e mi ricordo che alla fine di questo, eravamo lì solo parlando con... c'era un Premio Nobel che aveva fatto dei lavori sopra i virus delle piante, non mi ricordo il nome, e questo qui si congratula con me e dice, 'Ah', dice, 'Questo è stato il risultato più importante della giornata'.
[Q] Della giornata!
Sì, insomma così e questo... avendo poi quel metodo mi sono messo a usarlo per studiare le caratteristiche di questi virus. Poi, nel frattempo, quello era il periodo in cui c'era il terrore della poliomielite e specialmente negli Stati Uniti, era il vero terrore, perché la gente non mandava i figli a scuola anche per paura di quello. Naturalmente, piscina non se ne parlava, ecc. Quando è venuta questa questione, si vede che... c'era un'organizzazione che raccoglieva fondi per lavorare contro la poliomielite e il segretario di questa organizzazione viene da me un giorno e mi dice, 'Guardi, bisogna che lei sviluppi questo metodo delle placche per la poliomielite', e io dico, 'Va bene. Facciamo una cosa, bisogna che veda all'istituto, al Caltech se mi permettono di fare quello', perché è un virus infettivo e lì allora loro han pensato, han riconosciuto l'importanza della cosa, ma non volevano che lavorassi dentro l'istituto, per cui hanno affittato un piccolo isolato, una cosa a parte, dove hanno organizzato tutto il laboratorio e andavamo a lavorare lì.
[Q] Perché sarebbe stato molto pericoloso lavorare con un virus attivo. 
Beh, insomma sì, certo, si capisce. E lì abbiamo lavorato e abbiamo visto che in fondo non era difficile, che ci voleva solo però delle cellule speciali, non quelle di topo, ma ci volevano delle cellule di scimmia, perciò si doveva tenere, ci voleva del rene di scimmia e questo era molto difficile, ma insomma loro avevano mezzi, conoscenze, ecc. per cui ci potevano provvedere queste cellule e lì abbiamo visto che si poteva fare. L'unica differenza è che queste placche si sviluppavano molto più lentamente, il virus non era così aggressivo, si muovevano lentamente e perciò abbiamo pubblicato. Anche quello è stato un punto di partenza... è stato molto importante, io penso, per il virus, per il vaccino di Sabin, perché io avevo anche dimostrato che, se si prende il materiale, il virus presente in una placca, che questo virus è uno stipite puro di virus, mentre invece quelli che si adoperano normalmente sono miscele di qualità diverse, per cui se uno vuole ottenere un vaccino, cioè un virus attenuato che cresce, produce immunità, ma non infetta, non produce danni, come il vaccino di Sabin, bisogna avere dei mezzi come questo, e l'ho messo a punto, l'ho fatto vedere a Sabin. Non so Sabin quanto l'ha usato, ma penso che l'abbia usato almeno nei punti più cruciali del suo sistema. E poi abbiamo anche visto che certi stipiti del virus producono placche, caratteristiche diverse, anche questo ha potuto aiutare per isolare 'strains' diversi, perciò insomma è stata una cosa che ha avuto anche delle ripercussioni pratiche, molto bella.

Il mio punto successivo è venuto fuori dal fatto e, di nuovo, cose accidentali... come vedi, le cose accidentali capitano continuamente, hanno un significato enorme... pero' naturalmente, come dice lei, la fortuna aiuta, ma solo quelli che sanno vedere. E difatti questo è l'altro colpo di fortuna. Avevo uno studente che si chiamava Howard Temin, ed era venuto nel laboratorio anche un post-doc, che era un veterinario, che si chiamava Harry Rubin. Harry Rubin lavorava con virus per quello era venuto da me, perché lavorava con virus e voleva usare questi metodi per misurare... e questi virus che lui usava erano speciali, che producevano leucemie nei polli e lui ha studiato perciò un sistema di cellule tali che, se lui immetteva il virus in questo strato di cellule, le cellule che venivano infettate, cominciarano a crescere in modo anormale, facevano quello che chiamano i fuochi, dei punti e perciò questo era il mezzo per misurare l'attività di questi virus. Perciò, mentre negli altri, quelli che usavamo prima, era il fatto che il virus distruggesse la cellula quando si moltiplicava, invece in questo caso il virus invadeva la cellula e la faceva crescere. Faceva tutto l'opposto ma funzionava lo stesso, capisci? E Temin si è messo a lavorare con lui...
[Q] Con Rubin?
Con Rubin... perché gli piaceva questo sistema e poi Temin ha fatto la tesi sopra questo, perché lui... dal suo lavoro, che io sorvegliavo insomma, si vedeva questo, si vedeva che le cellule, una volta che venivano infettate, rimanevano infettate, cambiavano caratteristiche e queste caratteristiche poi rimanevano costanti. Perciò l'idea era che questo virus introduceva qualche cosa che persisteva in maniera da dare queste caratteristiche cambiate, ma costanti, alle cellule.
E mi ricordo che ha fatto sulla sua tesi... la laurea era tutto basato su questo... nel comitato per la tesi c'era Max Delbrück e Max Delbrück non voleva sentirlo quello, perché lui dice, 'Ma non c'è prova, questa è un'idea, ma non c'è prova'. Insomma, queste lunghe discussioni in fin dei conti, lui ha ragione, ma anche aveva torto, perché se c'era l'idea, bisogna perseguirla poi, andare a cercare il metodo per verificarla, ma non abbandonarla semplicemente perché non l'hai ancora verificata. Ma per me questo è stato molto importante, perché, per me, questa idea mi affascinava... quasi certamente questo è vero, perciò questo può essere la chiave del cancro, il cancro come malattia dei geni, però pensavo, come è possibile che questo succeda con un virus come quello, che e' un virus che come geni ci ha i geni fatti di RNA, non di DNA e l'RNA non è un portatore permanente di geni come il DNA. Perciò mi sembrava strano e allora ho pensato perché non prendiamo un virus che abbia le stesse effetti ma che sia, che abbia i geni di DNA. È capitato che, proprio in quel periodo, dei ricercatori di Washington, dell'NIH, avevano scoperto un virus di questo tipo, che avevano chiamato il virus del polioma. Lo chiamavano polioma perché, iniettato nei topi, produceva tumori in vari organi. E questo virus mi sembrava, dalle caratteristiche che aveva, che forse aveva i geni di DNA come tutti i virus, per cui ho chiesto che me ne mandassero un campione. L'abbiamo fatto crescere e abbiamo estratto l'acido nucleico ed era DNA, per cui avevo il gene, il virus che volevo, un virus che produceva tumori, ma che aveva i geni del DNA, per cui non dovevo preoccuparmi di quello che succede nell'RNA. In fondo, quello che succede nell'RNA è stato risolto più tardi da Temin e Baltimore.
Allora, così, abbiamo cominciato a lavorare sopra... sopra questo virus e, prima di tutto, abbiamo sviluppato i mezzi per il saggio, per... per questo virus abbiamo scoperto che ha una caratteristica anomala cioè che, su certe cellule, cresce moltiplicandosi e uccidendo le cellule; su altre cellule, le infetta e non cresce e le cellule diventano trasformate, cioe' cellule cancerose... le chiamiamo le cellule trasformate. Per esempio, nel topo, cresce, si moltiplica e uccide le cellule, nell'hamster forma questa trasformazione. Dunque, perciò lì la cosa era interessante, si vede che c'è qualche cosa che ha a che fare  il rapporto tra virus e cellula e perciò questo è diventato l'obiettivo principale del nostro lavoro.

With regard to this issue of Italian citizenship... because, at this time, taking American citizenship, I would have lost my Italian citizenship, therefore you see they didn't ask me to draw up any documents on this. I didn't know that nothing had to be done so I was thinking that in Italy they didn't know that I had taken American citizenship and they only found out when I had won the Nobel Prize, because then people spoke a lot about all this and, in fact, I have a copy of my birth certificate, which has a note on the side that says that my Italian citizenship was revoked on such and such a date, because this was no longer permitted... is very interesting.
[Q] But did Italy not try to give you dual citizenship or honorary citizenship?
No. I have honorary citizenship from a few towns. But you know, the fact is that in truth from a practical point of view, it doesn't matter, because I have a passport and I can go where I want, that's enough. If I wanted to have my Italian citizenship back I would have to move back to Italy and stay there for two years and so it's not really worth it... it would be against my ethics.

So, coming back to what I started to talk about before, that is, the polyoma virus and I was saying that its genome was made of DNA and that therefore it was right for me, in order to carry out all the work that was needed to understand how this DNA worked. And one of the things that I did straight away was to... I don't know if I really did it as a specific task or whether it came about while I was working with the virus, with viral DNA that I saw that this viral DNA was present in two forms and this could be seen particularly... to isolate the DNA, what is generally done is to put this virus that has DNA in it and protein outside, to put it in a substance that – a type of soap – that breaks the protein in such a way as to separate the proteins and the DNA, and then everything is placed in a centrifugal tube, where there is a thicker gradient at the bottom, less dense on the surface, or simply a gradient to maintain localisation. This is the aim, because this DNA needs to be sedimented in the test-tube, but you need to be certain that while it sedimentates, it remains where it is, then, because otherwise you cannot take it out of the tube, it would no longer be there. Doing this, generally, with this type of virus there is only a single band of this viral DNA, however here there were two and this amazed me.
Then I saw, looking at the literature, that a similar observation had been made with the papyloma virus, which is also DNA, and this was interpreted by the fact that there were virus particles which had one DNA length and others that had two lengths, therefore those which had one length moved more quickly... no, actually it's the other way round, those that had two lengths moved more quickly and those that had one stayed behind more.
So, to resolve this problem, we carried out what we call a column. A column means – you take a glass tube into which you put a substance which DNA tends to attack, but not permanently, so that if it makes this DNA go down through this column, every so often it attacks and so slows and then it attacks again and then slows down, so that if it is longer it has more possibility of attacking, if it is shorter, there is less possibility. Therefore, if one is of double length, it would stay more at the top, it would be more slowed down than the one with the single length. We did this with the polyoma DNA and we saw, instead that they came together, so, therefore, it is not a question of length, it's a question of structure and then: what is the structure? There are two possibilities: that of using to see and using the effect of an enzyme that cuts the DNA and the other was to observe these DNA molecules under an electronic microscope, because under a normal microscope you can't see, they are too small, but under an electronic microscope you can see properly. I started with enzymes, with DNase, as the enzyme that cuts DNA is called and, using this in very small doses, you could obtain a single cut per molecule and when I did this, I saw that the molecule that was the quickest, slowed down, so the cut caused a slowing down and there a possibility that seemed easy was that the DNase was cutting this molecule in a way that it was not cutting it into two pieces, but it always stayed in one piece, because it was circular. With the cut of a circle, a longer linear molecule was obtained and then this longer molecule... not longer, the same length, but a different shape I thought would have slowed down, given its shape.
Then the important thing was to carry out the test under the electronic microscope; however this didn't work, very strange indeed. There in Caltech, we didn't have an electronic microscope, they had one in the Chemistry department and I needed to check it with them and I tried loads of times to do this. I don't know, I think that there was some problem or other with the person in charge. Finally, I gave up and I published works saying that there were two shapes, one round and one not round, linear. Afterwards it emerged that this wasn't true and the shape that I... yes, was circular, but there were two circular shapes, a circular shape that... It is necessary to understand this that, when this DNA ring is formed during the replication of the virus, it is formed together with many proteins that protect it, so that the ring shape that is formed,  is not only the DNA shape, but the DNA shape plus proteins. When we purify them, the DNA that is usually in contact with the proteins, and the proteins are no longer there, always remain in nuclear form, therefore it no longer... in short, it keeps its helix shape. It does not remain a smooth helix, as it should be, instead it becomes entangled, then it forms this entanglement. This is why the fast form was the entangled form. If it cuts with the DNase, which generally only cuts one of the DNA strands, the entanglement comes undone. And then, therefore, the difference was between the entangled form and an un-entangled form, so always the fact that it was a circular shape, this remained there.

Questa questione della forma del DNA, aveva portato... aveva significato come indizio, vedi, perché già si pensava, già si avevano dei sospetti che il DNA del virus rimanesse dentro le cellule e, per esempio, si sapeva che queste cellule trasformate dal virus, compare una sostanza, un antigene che si riconosce con degli anticorpi speciali e non esiste nelle cellule normali; dunque, perciò, l'origine di questo antigene non era chiaro, ma era un indizio che forse c'erano dei geni del virus che erano attivi. E la questione che fosse circolare era molto utile, era un altro indizio, perché, se prendiamo una molecola circolare e una molecola lineare che si mettono insieme e poi c'è uno scambio tra le due, la molecola circolare si inserisce nella molecola lineare...
[Q] Non è il contrario? 
No, no, si inserisce, appunto, perché è rotonda, così questo si apre, hanno due pezzi. E questo perciò era un altro indizio che il DNA del virus fosse incorporato veramente nel DNA cellulare. Perciò, a quel punto lì, c'erano tutto questo gran numero di indizi e la questione era cercare di vedere come si poteva dimostrare, se era vero questo, che il DNA era nella cellula ed era incorporato. A questo punto, le cose sono andate molto bene per me perché, quel lavoro che avevo già fatto, aveva attratto un notevole numero di giovani ricercatori, che venivano a lavorare nel mio gruppo e molti di questi ricercatori provenivano da altri gruppi, dove avevano imparato anche delle tecnologie nuove e, sai, le tecnologie nuove sono fondamentali nella ricerca... per cui abbiamo cominciato con questi giovani ricercatori, appunto, mirando a questo problema e ciasceduno ha fatto il suo contributo e adesso posso spiegare come è successo. Per esempio, al principio, la prima cosa che si voleva sapere è questa: se prendiamo una cellula trasformata dal virus del polioma, il DNA del virus persiste nella cellula?
[Q] Domanda. Questa era la domanda.
E la domanda... allora è venuto fuori un modo per rispondere alla domanda. C'era la tecnica, come viene chiamata, dell'ibridizzazione delle molecule del DNA, dell'RNA, il che significa che se io ho due molecole che sono dello stesso tipo, uguali e le faccio sciogliere... perché i due filamenti si separano tutti e due... e poi li faccio riunire, allora formano due molecole che sono una miscela delle due. Questa è l'ibridizzazione. E questo si può fare facilmente e dimostra insomma... ed è- perciò... era venuto un giovane, era un tedesco, che veniva da un altro laboratorio dove facevano questa ibridizzazione come routine, diciamo, per cui lui l'aveva fatta... per cui abbiam detto, c'è il DNA del virus lì? Lui ha fatto l'esperimento... sì, c'era. Perciò, il DNA del virus era presente nelle cellule. Punto 1.
Poi, punto 2: il DNA che è presente è integrato nel cromosoma delle cellule oppure è separato? perché tutte e due le possibilità esistevano. E per fare questo, abbiamo dovuto organizzare un sistema per cui si potesse isolare il DNA virale dal DNA cellulare nello stesso tubo... e ora è questione di grandezza. Il DNA cellulare bisognava isolarlo in maniera che fosse molto grande e questo cominciava dal principio con difficoltà, perché con molte delle tecniche usate in quel tempo, quando si estraeva il DNA, il DNA veniva rotto in pezzi, per cui sarebbe stato impossibile distinguere l'uno dall'altro. Ma parlando con un collega che lavorava con il DNA, questo mi ha fatto vedere che loro usavano una tecnica speciale, per cui non isolavano il DNA dalle cellule col metodo normale, ma prendevano... formavano uno di questi gradienti di cui parlavo prima, alla cima del gradiente mettevano le cellule, non il DNA, ma tutte le cellule intatte, che erano mescolate con la sostanza che le faceva lisare e perciò permetteva poi al DNA di essere libero, ma erano tutte messe in cima, per cui non c'era nessun movimento alterazione, nessuna movimento per alterare il DNA. E poi si faceva, poi tutto il tubo si metteva nella centrifuga, in maniera che c'era progressiva diminuzione, e il DNA cellulare, che rimaneva quasi intatto, non perfettamente, ma quasi intatto, andava giù al fondo, mentre invece il DNA virale rimaneva un po' più alto. E questo permetteva perciò di vedere, prima di tutto di distinguere il DNA cellulare dal DNA virale e perciò permetteva di andare a vedere se il DNA virale era integrato prendendo, da una parte, cellule non trasformate e mescolate col DNA del virus e, dall'altra, le cellule trasformate, dove il DNA del virus era già lì. E facendo le due, si è visto chiaramente che, mentre nel controllo, i due, il DNA virale e l'altro, si separavano, nell'altro non si separavano affatto, il che era prova che il DNA cellulare era incorporato... che il DNA virale era incorporato nel DNA cellulare. Questo spiegava tutto, perché se allora se il DNA cellulare era nel DNA virale, i geni del DNA cellulare certamente funzionavano... poi l'abbiamo provato questo, ma già lì era un punto importante, perché se il DNA è lì, se ci sono i geni, i geni rispondono a tutti i sistemi della cellula e perciò dovrebbero essere espressi. Perciò questo era il punto di partenza per veramente capire che cos'è questa trasformazione virale.

And I remember that all this happened when I had to go to Cold Spring Harbor, in Long Island, where there were important conferences, there is one every year in the summer, and there was a test that had to be carried out and the result had already been obtained, but there was another test to check that it wasn't an artefact. My colleagues were preparing this, so I said, 'Okay, I'm going, I'm ready because I have to talk about this. I am ready to report on this, so send me a telegram to let me know the result of this test, if the test works or not'. And I remember, I waited and waited and the telegram didn't arrive; then came the time when I had to go onto the podium to speak, I started to speak and I started to explain all this saying that we were still waiting for this test then. At that moment an assistant arrived with the telegram, so I read it and the test was perfect, so there was a huge applause.
[Q] It arrived just in time. 
Yes.
[Q] How long did it take to reach this result in the telegram? 
Oh, a few years all in all, because it was a whole series of situations.
[Q] The importance was also this integration with other groups, because something...
Yes, precisely but this is the great thing. When we... for me, I learned from Levi, it was necessary to have... young people who come must be free, so that they can do their work. Therefore, when one of them came, I started to discuss where we were and I would say, 'We know this point, then it is necessary to see what we can do to progress', and see what technologies this person had and then see how to integrate this and so things would work well because...

Bene allora dunque siamo arrivati a questo punto dell'integrazione del DNA cellulare... ma questo ancora non spiegava il funzionamento; per esempio, non spiegava perché, in certe cellule, il DNA non si integrava, anzi causa la lisi della cellula e il DNA si moltiplica, mentre, invece, in altre il DNA non si moltiplica, ma si inserisce e trasforma la cellula. Questo evidentemente doveva esserci qualche interazione tra i geni della cellula e i geni del virus. E questo infatti abbiamo dimostrato... per esempio, il tipo di esperimento che abbiamo fatto è questo: partendo dal fatto che le cellule di topo venivano lisate, mentre invece le cellule di 'hamster' non erano lisate. L'esperimento che abbiamo fatto è questo: prendere una cellula di 'hamster' trasformata, perciò il DNA è lì, lo sappiamo questo, fonderla a una cellula di topo e forma questo ibrido. Cosa succede in questo ibrido? Perché ora lì abbiamo i geni del topo e difatti questo ibrido si muore...
[Q] Cioè, lo rifiuta praticamente? 
No, il virus si moltiplica, capisci? Perciò è questione del virus... quello che succede, cioè... se il virus si moltiplica nella cellula o no dipende dai geni della cellula, perciò se ci sono certi geni della cellula, il virus si moltiplica, se non ci sono, il virus... o viceversa, insomma, è una relazione coi geni della cellula, perciò questo dimostra l'influenza dei geni cellulari sul virus.
Poi, un'altra cosa importante, era quella di dire... ci devono essere,  se le cose son così, che ci sono dei geni per la crescita del virus e un'altro per la trasformazione, dobbiamo identificare questi geni che son diversi. E come fare quello? Come farlo è venuto fuori chiaramente, cioè, se i geni sono attivi in una cellula, questi geni danno luogo a quello che si chiama l'RNA messaggero e, come sappiamo, l'RNA è una molecola molto simile al DNA, ma solo con una piccola differenza, ed è facile ottenere l'RNA delle cellule e vedere quanti tipi di DNA ci sono facendolo ibridare, come dicevo prima, con pezzi diversi del DNA. E facendo questo, si è visto che nelle cellule trasformate, ci sono certi messaggeri, nelle cellule che si lisano ci sono altri messaggeri. Dunque, perciò, ci sono due gruppi di geni nel DNA, di cui uno è dedicato alla moltiplicazione del virus e l'altro alla trasformazione. Dunque, perciò...
[Q] Questo è un grande avanzamento.
Sì, sì questo è certo.

Se ci sono due tipi, ci dovrebbero essere anche due tipi di proteine dentro le cellule, perché le proteine sono l'espressione del gene, e infatti già si sapeva da qualche tempo che ci sono delle proteine specifiche del virus, che vengono chiamate sotto il nome generale 'T anti-gen', 'antigene T', antigene tumorale, capisci? E questi... poi si è visto, che ce n'erano parecchi tipi e noi siamo riusciti a dimostrare appunto che, uno di questi tipi era prodotto dai geni trasformanti e abbiamo visto anche che questa proteina andava a legarsi al DNA cellulare, perciò l'influenza sul DNA cellulare veniva in parte anche da quello, insomma. Perciò, tutto lì, il quadro generale veniva abbastanza chiaro. Naturalmente, c'erano piccoli punti relativamente da solvere e così abbiamo fatto dei mutanti per la trasformazione. E i mutanti sono varianti che si comportano diversi in condizioni diverse. Il più comune che si usava allora erano quelli che venivano chiamati i 'temperature mutants', che sono mutanti che non funzionano a una certa temperatura un po' alta, ma funzionano solo a temperature più basse, per cui, se si... isola il mutante e si alza la temperatura, la sua attività sparisce. Dunque perciò allora, abbiamo visto che con questi, si ottenevano anche, si cambiava anche l'abilità delle cellule stesse a rispondere a cambiamenti di temperatura e per questo il mutante era un mutante di temperatura, perché la proteina che è fatta era sensibile alla temperatura, perciò il virus evidentemente agiva sulla cellula con queste proteine, insomma.
E poi le cose sono andate avanti; c'è stato un mucchio di altro lavoro.  Dunque, questa era effettivamente la parte piu´importante, per la ragione per cui mi han dato il Premio Nobel, perché era questa interazione...  come dice la modificazione, la giustificazione, del virus...  dice per aver scoperto l'interazione reciproca tra i geni del virus e i geni della cellula. Ma insomma... per me, la cosa ancora più fondamentale era di aver dimostrato che un gene, o uno o due geni del virus sono capaci di trasformare la cellula, perciò spostava il problema a che cosa fa questo gene che trasforma e poi, naturalmente, sulla base di quello, si può pensare al cancro normale forse avviene nello stesso modo, non perché c'è un gene del virus, che normalmente non c'è, ma perché un gene stesso della cellula si altera e difatti dopo queste cose son dimostrate...
[Q] È stato proprio, diciamo, l'apertura a cercare di capire per il cancro.
Sì, certo. E perciò tutto questo è stato molto bello.

[Q] Ma la concomitanza... siccome tu hai detto è, 'per questo che mi hanno dato il Premio Nobel', e per me lo hai detto con grande semplicità questo... ma la concomitanza del Nobel con Temin e con Baltimore. 
No, ma queste son cose diverse. Tutti indipendenti ma... questo è perche evidentemente c'era qualche cosa di comune nell'attaccare il problema... cioè nell'attaccarlo, c'era una certa logica, un certo modo di agire, un modo di comportarsi che era simile, insomma. Ed è questo quello che dicevo... che non solo noi che eravamo parte di un gruppo in partenza, ma anche quelli che son venuti fuori dal mio laboratorio, che non erano parte di questo gruppo. Anche quelli avevano ereditato, diciamo così, questa capacità insomma. Questa, insomma, è una piramide che parte da Giuseppe Levi, capisci?
[Q] Eh appunto, sì sì la lezione avevi cominciato dicendo la grande lezione di Levi, proprio. 
Come?
[Q] La lezione di Levi, avevi detto. 
Sì, senz'altro. E tutti lo riconoscono, sai? Non sono solo io che lo riconosco, la Rita lo riconosce, Salvador Luria lo riconosceva, lui purtroppo non c'è più. Vabbene, perciò... vediamo un poco... dopo di quello... ah, ecco, dopo di quello cosa succede? Questo grande lavoro, questo grande successo che avevamo fatto, che era dovuto, in parte, a un gruppo di collaboratori bravissimi che avevo, non c'è dubbio, questo ha attratto l'attenzione appunto a questi ricercatori e Jim Watson voleva costruire, a Cold Spring Harbor, un gruppo di ricerca, appunto, sopra il virus del cancro, ecc. e quello che ha fatto è stato offrire delle condizioni bellissime a tutti i miei ricercatori, tutti i miei collaboratori. Se li è portati via tutti quanti!
[Q] Tutto depauperato! 
Tutto depauperato.

So we succeeded, I was alone, you understand, and so the question was what to work on next. But naturally I always had people that came and therefore we worked together. For example, Paul Berg came and Paul Berg was very interested in viral DNA and when he came to my laboratory... it was he who wanted to come because he knew of this perfect knowledge of DNA, these things... and he wanted to study structurally, because he is a chemist. And so we started to work with him, we provided the cell DNA, the cells are for extracting the DNA. Therefore, he realised that it was difficult for him to take the DNA in sufficient quantities to be able to carry out the structural studies that he wanted to conduct. And then he started to work, thinking of other methods and one of those things that he thought of – very original, this – was to take the DNA of the virus and to put it in a bacteria, in such a way that when the bacteria reproduced, the virus DNA could also reproduce and in the end populations of bacteria were obtained all with the virus DNA inside. And, in fact, this is what he managed to achieve. And he therefore managed to obtain significant quantities of the virus, of viral DNA which allowed him to carry out the structural work that he wanted to do. But the important result was not the structural work, but the technique used to increase the number of particles of the virus, of the viral DNA. Because this was the basis of genetic engineering, which was developed... so, in fact, genetic engineering was born in my laboratory only with our help. But this was the work of Paul Berg, you see?

So, at this point, there was a problem in our family, because we had had a daughter. Maureen and I were married for a few years, but we hadn't had any children, because we didn't want them and then, at a certain point, Maureen decided that it would be nice to have a child and so we did... we had a child and this child was Fiona. Now Fiona was born in 1970, at the end of December and, after all these things happened... and then afterwards naturally she took up a lot of my attention, so we were all concentrating on...
[Q] On the girl. 
And lab work took second place, because there was this little girl. I remember, in the evening, we had to rock her a little so that she would sleep... she was good though. In the morning, I'd get up when she was already a few months old, she was eating normal food. I would make scrambled eggs... how do you say that in Italian?
[Q] Strapazzate.
Strapazzate, uova strapazzate.  And she would eat these scrambled eggs.
[Q] And it was you that cooked? 
Sometimes, yes, of course. With all this, the attention was focused on that.

And then Maureen started to worry, she would say, 'Now, how can we bring this child up in this environment?' You know, at the end of the 1960s, there was this whole movement, etc. This worried many of us, all of us and especially Maureen and we decided that we had to leave the USA and so I got in touch with an acquaintance of mine, a friend in London, who... who was a very influential person, so, because he was the director of the laboratory of...
[Q] In Imperial? Is that right?
... of the laboratory... What was it called? The Imperial Cancer Laboratory in London, and so I... well, he called me, he said, 'Come and work with us', so he gave me a position there and I went to London to work. And this, from the point of view of our daughter, was wonderful for her, because we went there when she was two years old, and... I don't know how, Maureen knew someone who had... a rather old person who had one of these small...  a type of... what's it called... Where they look after children... a nursery school, informal so...
[Q] Almost in a house? 
Yes.
[Q] A little home, perhaps?
No, there were a few children and then these children would have things to play with, but they were also able to do practical things, for example, reading, writing, seeing how things work, doing all this...   Yes, learning. So Fiona, grew up... it was wonderful. So when she reached the age in England when children can go to school, when they have passed four and a half years old, we took her to a well-known school in the neighbourhood and there they tested her and decided she was very clever and that perhaps we shouldn't put her in the first class but in a higher class, because...
[Q] Just like her Dad! 
So, then in the end, the result was that she was advanced two years. You see, this is the significance that I talk about of childhood education... sending children to school at six years old, this is too late, you need to send them a lot earlier, because then children learn a whole load of things.
[Q] And then this happened 30 years ago or even earlier with you. But think nowadays children that you have... it is important not to leave them like that. 
But now an episode that I remember very well... on questions, precisely, of how children learn and despite us we are not aware of it. So I remember, when my daughter was born, one of our friends sent a package where there was a type of book that said 'to create an active mind'; and what it was, was a series of boxes with the name written in large letters and there were two that were bigger – these boxes – and one said 'mummy & daddy', and the others were all English words. So, out of curiosity, we, every so often, when we took these and we showed them, our daughter looked at them and didn't seem to be interested at all. I realised soon with time that she was learning something, because after a little time, when the larger boxes were taken out, she immediately said 'mummy or daddy', because she knew that they were there, but she wasn't able to read for the time being. But then the definitive proof – it was beautiful – when she was, I don't know, about a year and a half, I'd say...
[Q] Very young then. 
Very young. We were... when a friend came to visit... this was when we were still in the USA, we were at 'La Jolla'. We were all gathered around a round table, there was me, Maureen and our friend, and Fiona who was not quite walking properly, but moving from one knee to the other... and there was this thing on the table, this book, this collection of things. Then I was explaining, he asked me what it was and I explained what it was. And he took one of these and showed it to her. She was watching him and said 'elbow' and it was perfectly right. Perhaps she read all these things already, but she didn't let us know. And in fact we tried afterwards, subsequently, but nothing, she didn't respond. You see that it's strange, this is the aptitude. But the fact is that they learn in a fantastic way.

The work that I described about the characteristics of genes and the virus, the virus, the polyoma and SV 40, because they are very similar, was started at Caltech, however it wasn't continued there, but it continued in another institute, at the Salk Institute, which is situated in 'La Jolla', in San Diego, southern California. This occurred for the following reason: after a few years, after having proved that the vaccine worked well against polio, Dr. Salk, who produced the vaccine, developed his interests in another direction, that is in trying to promote the development of science together with the development of art. Art and science together, this was his idea. He had considerable opportunity because the foundation, called the March of Dimes in the USA, that had obtained funding to produce the vaccine, still had huge possibilities with regard to funding and they supported him completely, because he was their hero, who made them famous. And so his idea was to construct a new institute, where one could work both on science and on art and he started to talk with many people, a small group of people formed around him, one of whom was Jacques Monod, well-known at that time for his work in biology, and others and quite a few of these started to consult me to be one of the people that could start this fabulous institute. And so we spoke for a few months or even years, I'd say and, in the end, they all together convinced me that it would be worth me leaving Caltech to go to the Salk Institute, that then did not exist of course.
And I remember that, when this was decided, Jonas Salk decided that the architect that would build this building would be Louis Kahn, because he was very well known as an architect in general, but particularly for the construction of scientific buildings and so I had the pleasure of knowing Louis Kahn, who is a very interesting person, far from ordinary, but very interesting. And I remember that a very important thing, when I think of it properly, is that, at a certain point, he told me that he wanted to come and ask me to see what I needed in terms of the laboratory and then I said, 'Yes, of course', without a doubt and while waiting for him I thought of the things I'd need, how many rooms, how much space, this and that, etc. So then he arrived, we sat down and he said, 'So, what do you think?' And I started: spaces here, spaces there. 'Oh', he said, 'No, no, I don't mean that, spaces, etc. I want to know what makes a discovery'. Then I said, 'Well, a discovery starts with some existing information that raises questions, then someone thinks if only it had a certain significance, then he will look into this, read all that has been studied thus far in order to be completely up to date, then will formulate a theory and finally, when the hypothesis is well formulated, you have to go to the laboratory to see if it is right or not'.  This was enough for him.
In fact, you see how the institute is organised; in the centre there are these two study wings, each scientist, every laboratory head as well as important scientists, has an office and the office is completely isolated, but then connected by a passage to the laboratory. Therefore the idea is that the scientist formulates his ideas in his office and when the ideas are formulated, he goes to the lab to test them. Because effectively this is how things work and he... he used this to structure the institute, which is a really remarkable thing.

[Q] I would like to ask why did you say that the institute was for science and for art as well, what do you mean by art? 
Well, this was him, not me. In fact when, it has to be said that this was a period, the first year after I decided to participate, there was nothing. Then, I went to Glasgow, in Scotland to work in a laboratory there. I spent a year there. When I returned, they already had temporary laboratories that they were called temporary, but this is in 1965 and they are still there now, so... however, they were very useful in principle and we started to work and then, in the meantime, this large reinforced concrete laboratory was built and everyone was saying it's a masterpiece of architecture, and then, when this was built, Salk introduced the art part and I remember art, in fact, general art... I remember that there was some write... Now I don't recall his name, the one that wrote all these novels about fantasy...
[Q] Science fiction? 
Yes, science fiction. The first was... oh God, a strange bacteria that... well, very well known, but now I don't remember who he was... the name and he was there for a while, there was a French philosopher, again I can't remember his name, also well known, who was there and then there were also other younger ones who... well, there was a group, so... There was not a lot of interaction among the scientists and this group. I had the opportunity to speak with them once or twice, but in short it wasn't a productive exchange, let's say that, curiosity more than anything. And I think that they were there  because they were thinking that something would come out, but out of curiosity more than anything, to see what there was...
[Q] Yes, but perhaps it was also a type of think-tank. 
It could have been that. I don't think that it was developed in this direction.
[Q] Think-tank for scientists, perhaps. 
Sure, in fact then the scientists, as soon as they arrived there, started to work like before and work was going very well... all these results that I was explaining earlier, that I already explained. And then in fact, then the art part essentially disappeared. At the start there was a painting exhibition within the institute that created a lot of controversy, because... I don't know, some people said that some of the paintings were provocative. One person said, 'There is a nude woman there',  and another said, 'That one is masturbating', so... Then there was a painting with the flag of the United States and an individual urinating onto it, so you understand? These were then put to one side and there was a guard that if a young boy wanted to go in, he couldn't, it was restricted to adults, so these were elements that didn't really help the institute to develop. Ultimately the institute became a total science institute, it became one of the largest scientific research centres in the United States, and in the world. And it still is.

Dunque, allora, come ho detto, a un certo punto, appunto per la questione della nascita di nostra figlia, abbiamo deciso di andare a Londra e a Londra il lavoro è stato molto, molto più ridotto, appunto, per le ragioni che già spiegavo, per la necessità di essere vicini a questa ragazza, cercare di aiutarla e anche per altre ragioni, insomma le difficoltà che ci sono... l'Inghilterra è un paese molto strano, ci sono cose estremamente interessanti, ma anche ci sono difficoltà che, per esempio, negli Stati Uniti non esistono. Sono le difficoltà dell'organizzazione sociale, diciamo così, dove ogni individuo che ha una certa funzione in una scala, vuole assolutamente lasciare la sua impronta... perciò, per esempio, nell'istituto lì dov'ero io, c'era anche un direttore dei servizi e questo direttore dei servizi naturalmente aveva la responsabilità per tutto il personale, eccetto il personale degli scienziati, e insomma era difficilissimo andare d'accordo con lui, perché lui voleva le cose fatte in un certo modo e non c'era niente a che fare, non si poteva ragionare, capisci, è fatto così o niente.  Non era flessibile.  Non era piacevole, è stato piuttosto spiacevole. D'altra parte... no, dicevo, perciò lì abbiamo continuato per un po' di tempo a perfezionare questo lavoro sopra i geni del- virus, specialmente del polioma e anche dell'SV 40. Avevo un gruppo molto più piccolo di quello che avessi... naturalmente al Caltech o al Salk.
[Q] Ma i collaboratori che avevi lì, il gruppo di ricercatori che avevi lì, venivano... li hai raccolti in quel momento oppure venivano... 
No, alcuni sono venuti con me che erano già al Salk, sono due o tre e poi alcuni altri son venuti qui, ma c'era cinque o sei persone, non era un gran gruppo, ma insomma si lavorava abbastanza. Come dicevo, si è continuato a perfezionare alcuni punti del virus e dell'azione del virus e anche avevo cominciato a interessarmi di più a organismi di complessità più elevata, per esempio, cellule, perché una cellula ha una complessità enormemente maggiore a quella del virus e il numero dei geni che contiene, ecc. Insomma, cominciando a cercare di capire, di afferrare come si potesse penetrare in questa complessità della cellula. Perciò, al principio, erano cose non molto interessanti, insomma, erano utili per formare un'idea di queste cose.

Ma poi tutto è stato interrotto dal giorno che ho preso il Premio Nobel, perché il Premio Nobel è venuto lì a Londra e lì... è interessante seguire gli avvenimenti, perché, per uno scienziato, il Premio Nobel è una cosa veramente incredibile, perché ce ne sono così pochi, è così raro per uno scienziato, perché insomma è proprio una cosa straordinaria. Mi ricordo che io andavo a lavorare a questo istituto – noi non abitavamo nel centro di Londra, abitavamo fuori Londra, nel Kent, come si chiama, a un paesetto, allora era un paesetto chiamato Chislehurst – e, al mattino, io prendevo il treno per andare a lavorare e il treno era sempre pieno zeppo, naturalmente era un posto scomodo, si doveva stare in piedi forse quasi tutto il tempo, ma insomma però funzionava regolarmente, tutto andava bene. Mi ricordo, appunto, arrivavo lì, lì avevo uno studio con due camere, anzi e nell'entrata c'era la segretaria, che si sedeva lì, e poi io il piccolo studio mio privato a fianco. E lì tenevo tutti i miei documenti, insomma se avevo delle idee che scrivevo, ecc., era tutto lì. Perciò, quando arrivavo, entravo lì, c'era la segretaria, salutavo e andavo... e poi separato c'era il laboratorio e il laboratorio era mantenuto da una bravissima tecnica che... noi discutevamo che cosa fare e poi lei organizzava come farlo. E appunto, una mattina arrivo lì... anzi, sono arrivato, mi sono cambiato, ho levato il cappotto, l'ho lasciato sul, nel mio studio e poi sono andato al laboratorio. Tornando dal laboratorio, mi accorgo che c'è la segretaria che ha un foglio di carta in mano, lo agita e mi dice, 'Cosa vuol dire questo?' Vado a vedere cosa c'era lì. Era un telegramma che veniva da Stoccolma, da una persona che conosco e conoscevo già da molto tempo, e che diceva: 'Congratulazioni, ci vedremo a Stoccolma in dicembre', ma era anonimo, non c'era nessuna specificata cosa...
[Q] Non c'era... c'era la firma?
Sì, c'era la firma, ma non diceva di che cosa si trattava, perché non poteva dirlo, perché l'annuncio ufficiale sarebbe avvenuto qualche ora dopo, capisci? Beh, insomma, allora, lei mi dice, 'Cosa vuol dire?', ma dico 'Mi pare che l'unica cosa che può voler dire è il Premio Nobel'. Questa povera donna è rimasta quasi colpita da un fulmine. E allora io dico, beh, prima di tutto, telefono a Maureen e allora ho detto è successo questo e lei mi dice, 'Bene, stai tranquillo, non facciamo nessun rumore finché non c'è qualche cosa di molto più noto'. E lei mi diceva che, nel frattempo, lei aveva organizzato un piccolo lunch con delle amiche che aveva, erano donne i cui figli erano nella stessa classe di Fiona, capisci, perciò il solito e io vabbè. E allora, io vado lì, mi metto a lavorare, parlo col mio amico che era direttore dell'istituto e anche lui dice, 'Beh, aspettiamo, vediamo come vanno le cose'. E così passano due o tre ore, viene l'ora di andare a fare il lunch, vado giù dove c'è la caffetteria, ci sediamo lì col mio amico e cominciamo a mangiare. A un certo punto, lì dalla porta, vedo, devo dire, l'enorme pancia della mia segretaria, perché era...
[Q] Robusta? 
No, no, era incinta e vicina alla nascita. E lei... Oh, dico, 'C'è qualcosa di serio se lei viene qui!' E lei... allora vado a vedere cosa c'è dice, 'C'è un giornalista di Stoccolma che vuole parlarle al telefono'. 'Ah', ho detto, 'Questo allora è vero'. Allora l'ho detto al mio amico e così le cose sono andate avanti benissimo, poi è arrivato il telegramma, poi le festività, tutto sai lì nel laboratorio. Quando c'è stata questa ultima cosa, ho telefonato a Maureen dicendo, 'Le cose, non c'è dubbio, è proprio vero' e lei poi mi ha raccontato che, quando ha ricevuto questa telefonata, lei era ritornata con le sue amiche, così, e le amiche le han detto, 'Ma che cosa c'è, sembri preoccupata. Cosa succede? È successo qualche cosa?' Dice, 'Sì, mio marito ha vinto il Premio Nobel'. Perciò le amiche naturalmente... perciò le cose sono andate così, perciò molto bello. Ed è interessante la reazione, perché io abitavo a Chislehurst, che era una zona in un certo qual modo privilegiata, e mi ricordo che parlando a gente così, anzi mi dicevano... la gente era stupita, dice- Come è possibile che uno di questo posto possa avere il Premio Nobel! Perché loro pensavano che son tutti ricchi, persone ricche che non lavorano, ecc.
[Q] Mah pensa, strano però. 
Beh, questa è insomma la prospettiva della gente.

Well, this changed my life enormously, because suddenly there was an influx of colleagues who wanted, in a certain way, to benefit from this news in the directions that interested them and particularly this group of epidemiologists in London, Peto and another who was called... so these... because they had discovered, from an epidemiological viewpoint, that smoke produces lung cancer, therefore a very clear connection between these two things, and in fact they wanted me to represent them to  promote this idea, you see, which, after all, I decided to go along with. So, we got ourselves organised, I had to write a presentation in which I highlighted all this, in short everything went well. Then, on 10 December, we went to Stockholm and there we were met by the other two who received the Nobel Prize, who were David Baltimore and Temin, Baltimore and Temin. And these two were my colleagues, my partners, Temin was my student. Baltimore was with me, I brought him to the laboratory and we worked alongside each other, I don't mean together, but for some time, therefore we were part of the same basic group, which was great. So, naturally, I received the Nobel Prize for this work on the relation of genes, the virus and the genes of the cell  this was the formulation – and they took it, because both contributed to the discovery – of the inverse transcription, as it is called, therefore it showed that, although normally the information is in the DNA and is transferred from the DNA to the RNA, there are conditions in which the opposite happens, that is that the information in the RNA is transferred to the DNA. And this explains why Rubin and Temin's work on these viruses that contain RNA, instead of DNA, but which produced cancer, was fundamentally similar to what I was studying with genes because the virus enters the cell, the RNA is combined, combines with forms of DNA and then this DNA is what makes all the rest, you see, so there is no difference between the two... it is a purely temporary difference and this, therefore, went very well. Naturally, this question of smoke, Temin was very strongly against this, so when there was the press conference in which we participated, he entered into the room where there was a long oval table, and on this table, there were three ashtrays. As soon as Temin saw this, he said, 'Take these ashtrays away immediately, I won't come in if they are there', so they had to take them away. And then, in the discussions that ensued, he always stressed this point very vehemently.

Poi successivamente, naturalmente, le cose son cambiate, perché io sono ritornato a Londra e da Londra è stato immediatamente...
[Q] Cioè da Glasgow torni a Londra?
No, no, da Stoccolma siamo ritornati a Londra e lì sono stato perseguitato, diciamo così, da offerte di tutti i tipi, che venivano specialmente dagli Stati Uniti. Mi ricordo che c'era i nomi io non me li ricordo... lì a 'La Jolla', no a Los Angeles c'era allora un imprenditore che era il capo dell'Occidental Petroleum, che si chiamava, insomma... Questa era una persona sempre interessata un po' della scienza, dei risultati, ecc, ma non era un interesse, direi, veramente di scienza, era più che altro un interesse, così, di apparenze, di opinione pubblica, insomma perciò lui, questa idea... siccome lui conosceva me già da tempo, voleva assolutamente che io facessi qualcosa con lui e allora mi telefona un giorno... non era lui che ha telefonato, ma faceva telefonare da uno dell'istituto, e dice, 'Ah, questa riunione vorremmo che lei venisse qui e io dico, 'Oh, ma guardi, io ho qui... mia figlia va a scuola, non posso lasciare questo', ecc. 'Ah', dice, 'Non fa niente, porti la bambina'. 'Beh', dico, 'La bambina sì', ma dice, 'Ah, porti, quella persona che si tiene'.
[Q] Ah, sì, la nurse.
La nurse. Porti la nurse, così. E poi c'era un'altra cosa che mi ha stupito, insomma che lui, qualunque cosa dicevo, diceva, 'Portala', insomma avrei potuto portare...
[Q] Non è un problema, purché tu arrivassi.
Purché io arrivassi e infatti poi, alla fine, sono andato, perché non potevo resistere più. E poi l'altra cosa è stata che...
[Q] Ma la proposta qual'era? 
Di partecipare a questa riunione, insomma. La cosa più importante che è successa è che la gente al Salk Institute hanno deciso che mi volevano indietro, che dovevo ritornare indietro e così sono ritornato.

E questo forse andava bene, perché nostra figlia, a quell'epoca, aveva raggiunto, mi pare, sei anni e aveva completamente sviluppato delle idee, ecc, non era più influenzabile facilmente come sarebbe stata se fosse stata qui da noi, anzi aveva un carattere molto fermo, molto... e così siamo ritornati. Naturalmente il problema è stato anche per lei, perché quando siamo rivenuti a La Jolla, dove c'è l'istituto, abbiamo comprato una casa per abitarci lì. Nelle vicinanze di questa casa c'era una scuola, che era la scuola proprio della città... naturalmente l'avremmo mandata lì e infatti ha cominciato ad andare lì. E ci siamo accorti dopo che il carattere è completamente cambiato; invece di essere com'era prima, molto espansiva, molto... era tanto solitaria, chiusa, non parlava molto, quando si chiedeva della scuola non aveva niente da dire, ecc. e poi allora siamo andati a parlare con la maestra e lei diceva, 'Sì, questa bambina è molto più avanti' – perché era in prima, in prima elementare e molto più avanti ma – 'd'altra parte noi non possiamo fare niente, non possiamo cambiare questo'...
[Q] Come avevate poi d'abitudine in famiglia. 
Allora abbiamo cercato di metterla lì che istruisse un ragazzo russo, che perciò doveva imparare l'inglese, così ecc., ma quella non era una cosa che l'attraeva. Per cui sono andato a parlare... anzi sono andato a parlare a Salk e lui dice che conosceva una persona, una direttrice di una scuola privata e siamo andati a parlare a lei e lei dice, 'Beh, esaminiamola la ragazza'. 'Ah, questa ragazza potremmo metterla forse in quarta', però, dice, 'Quello è troppo, perché', dice, 'la differenza di età sarebbe troppo forte'. Dice, 'La metteremo in terza'.  Anche lei due anni.  Perciò ha cominciato con il vantaggio dei due anni.
[Q] È una tradizione di famiglia, allora questa? 
Eh, si vede!

So we returned there, and when we returned to 'La Jolla' and I returned to the Salk Institute, I started to think of the future, about what I would do because the work on viruses was essentially finished, there were other things that could be done, but I don't know, it didn't seem worth it to me to spend the rest of my life working on this. And I therefore thought that it would be interesting to start working on more complex systems. The system that caught my attention was cancer, still the field of cancer, because what I had worked on before was within the field of cancer, however I now wanted to concentrate on real cancer, breast cancer. And there were two reasons why I chose this: one because it is a very widespread cancer that affects many women, and the other because the wife of one of my dear friends at Caltech had developed breast cancer. So, I felt to a certain degree that it was my duty to try and work in this area as the cancer attacked directly rather than indirectly, as I had been studying previously. And so straightaway you can see the complexity. It's good to talk about breast cancer, but the breast, what is the breast, what cells are present there and how can one be distinguished from another, how do they develop, etc. and therefore I started to study this. I focused on rats, because they are a fairly good animal for this type of work. Studying both the formation, the development of the breast of the rat and cellular types that could be found in the rat, making cell cultures to see how they behaved, in fact, with a small number of collaborators, we made some progress in this field.
Then, something that was very important and that deserved to be developed more than we developed it, is that I decided... in fact, we needed resources to identify the various cells that there were and naturally one of the means is simple, that of the microscope, but this is very rough. So, genes, speaking about genes it wasn't possible, because we didn't know anything about genes. Then the only thing that could be done was to go to the point after genes, which is proteins. And to study proteins, the means that were available then were monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies are molecules that connect specifically to a type of protein called monoclonal, because the clone is... the number of cells is derived from a single cell, so they were monoclonal, because all the cells of this complex that produced the antibody produced a type of antibody that usually, if the cells are taken together with the organism, the blood, the production of antibodies is huge in number, but each is produced in minimal quantities, so they are not used. Therefore, the technology to produce these monoclonal antibodies was developed in England. There was... I knew one of the people involved in this well, so we decided to adopt this monoclonal method. Thus, we constructed a number of monoclonal antibodies, which each recognised a cell type. This allowed us, therefore, to start building how these cell types change, as if... the evolution, the development of these cell types and this sufficiently clarified the conditions of development of the mammary gland. One thing that would be very interesting, that unfortunately we didn't pursue, is that we also made monoclonal antibodies against breast cancer and we identified – these always in rats, therefore,  not in humans – and we identified monoclonal antibodies specific to cancer. In fact, today, there are specific antibodies for breast cancer, that are used a lot in therapy.

[Q] You were talking about monoclonal antibodies and things about the rat. 
Yes, what I was saying, precisely, that unfortunately we didn't continue this any longer.
[Q] But why did you not continue this? Because you thought...
I don't know, because we didn't think that it could be a great help for diagnosis, for therapy, because there is a lot of variability in cancer. But in fact, what – in men, in women – what happens is that there is, in a third of cancers, there is a gene that develops a lot, that multiplies more than normal and therefore there was a very strong presence of this express protein in the cells.
[Q] And this is still for breast cancer? 
For breast cancer, precisely. Therefore... but this is a rather special situation. Normally, monoclonal antibodies against cancers, there are only a few that are useful. Yes, if we had continued with this, perhaps we would have... but well, these are the things of research, highs and lows of research. So, now we arrived at this point. Then, there was a lot of interest in the institute to do with AIDS, which became the disease of the moment, so they wanted me to return to virology more than anything else, rather than continuing in that direction. And then I organised – because I didn't know anything about this area – to go and spend a little time in Basel, where there was this immunology institute. Naturally, in AIDS the immunological issue is very important so, only to understand a little, to see, to speak to people and this... therefore I went in 1988, I was there and I started to work a little in this area, essentially speaking and listening.

Poi c'è stato un avvenimento importante, che ha interrotto tutto ed è questo che, all'istituto Salk, c'era il presidente, che era stato presidente già da una diecina d'anni, e che anche lui ha sviluppato l'AIDS, per cui era diventato molto ammalato e lì all'istituto non sapevano come fare, perché lui come presidente non funzionava più, e allora mi hanno telefonato dicendomi se potevo venire a fare il presidente magari temporaneamente, magari per un periodo di alcuni mesi così in maniera da avere tempo per cercare un altro presidente per succedere a questo qui che era ammalato. Ma io ho pensato, insomma, sentivo che dovevo qualche cosa all'istituto Salk, perciò ho pensato che, sì, se posso essere di aiuto in un periodo così critico, lo dovevo fare, per cui sono ritornato, ho lasciato lì l'AIDS e Basilea e sono ritornato lì, per cui lì è cominciata adesso una nuova carriera, perché io ero con l'idea che sarei stato magari sei mesi, ma infatti ci sono stato quasi cinque anni, capisci? Perché, insomma la situazione, dal punto di vista dell'istituto, era un antagonismo tra il presidente e la facoltà. Il presidente non capiva bene la facoltà, non potevano andare d'accordo e perciò le cose andavano male, parecchi dei maggiori ricercatori già avevano ricevuto offerte e le consideravano pronti a partire quando sono arrivato lì.
Per cui, questo è stato il mio compito principale, prima di tutto quello di convincere questa gente a rimanere e poi di dare al l'istituto, alla facoltà dei poteri che non avevano e che dovrebbe avere, cioè di essere parte delle decisioni più importanti, non che siano esclusivamente del consiglio di amministrazione e del presidente.
[Q] Direi, una libertà e anche una certa autonomia. 
Certo, esattamente. E questo... il consiglio di amministrazione che c'era allora ha capito, per fortuna, ha capito bene la situazione ed è stato d'accordo su questo, per cui abbiamo ristrutturato tutta la struttura organizzativa dell'istituto. Abbiamo costruito un consiglio nella facoltà, che era chiamato l'Academic Council, il consiglio accademico, eletto da tutti i membri della facoltà con periodi non troppo lunghi, con rotazioni, insomma... un sistema di flusso, ma che rappresentava tutta la facoltà. E questo è piaciuto molto naturalmente alla facoltà, per cui tutti hanno ritirato le loro partenze e sono rimasti tutti lì. E da allora, l'istituto è andato avanti molto bene.

Appunto poi, ci sono stati, dopo quasi cinque anni, il consiglio di amministrazione, d'accordo con la facoltà, hanno trovato un nuovo presidente temporaneo. Però questo non andava bene, dopo sei mesi se ne è andato anche lui, allora io... poi dopo ne son venuti altri due temporanei che poi, alla fine, sono arrivati al buon senso e hanno preso questo che adesso è lì e perciò questo è stato lì già da sei anni. Questo mi fa molto piacere, che le cose vadano regolarmente, che io sia libero completamente.
[Q] Ma io so che andando al Salk anche adesso, se tu vai e chiedi a una signora, ti fa vedere dal cortile interno che c'è da quel patio che c'è, dice, 'Quella è la finestra dello studio del Prof. Dulbecco. Lui non è qui, ma è sempre qui'. Così dicono. 
Perciò, quando sono andato a fare il presidente, ho abbandonato la ricerca, perché pensavo insomma io non posso fare due cose bene nello stesso tempo e quello che si doveva fare per l'istituto era molto importante, perciò mi sono dedicato interamente a quel lavoro lì.

Studiando queste... appunto, ti dicevo che studiavo queste cellule della ghiandola mammaria, tumori della ghiandola mammaria, del ratto e tutto questo. Con anticorpi monoclonali potevamo entrare un po', insomma nella genetica, perché gli anticorpi monoclonali riflettono anche alcuni tipi di geni. Però, insomma, era ancora una supposizione minima, quello che avevamo come supposizione era così poco che io pensavo, questo insomma, non è assolutamente sufficiente. E pensandoci bene, mi è venuta l'idea che si doveva fare un balzo avanti veramente, cioè quello di cercare di identificare tutti i geni di un organismo. E come si fa a identificare tutti i geni di un organismo? Noi sappiamo che i geni sono una parte del DNA, sappiamo come sono fatti e quali sono le caratteristiche, ecc, per cui se avessimo tutta la struttura del DNA, tutta la sequenza, come viene chiamata, delle basi del DNA, si potrebbero identificare tutti i geni e perciò si potrebbe lavorare con tutti i geni. Allora ho pensato, beh, questo sequenziamento del genoma... ho pensato bene, parlando anche a colleghi che lavoravano in campi di questo tipo, insomma, era chiaro che, era una cosa molto, molto difficile da ottenere, ma era una cosa possibile, purché veramente ci fosse un forte impegno. E allora ho cominciato a parlare pubblicamente di questa idea e la prima volta che l'ho fatto, l'ho fatto al Caltech perché lì... era al Caltech, anzi?
[Q] Non era mica...? 
Aspetta un momento.
[Q] O fu a Los Angeles?
Fu a Los Angeles. Insomma c'era l'inaugurazione di un istituto a Los Angeles e mi avevano invitato a parlare, a fare il preludio, a fare la conferenza all'inizio. E io ho pensato che quella era una buona occasione, perché c'era un mucchio di gente, tutti scienziati interessati e perciò l'ho centrato... la mia presentazione, appunto, su questa possibilità di sequenziare il genoma, come si chiama, il genoma è tutto un insieme di geni... allora pensavo all'uomo, a quello umano. E mi ricordo che ho parlato... parlando, insomma alla fine pensavo di avere delle reazioni, ma invece non c'è stata nessuna reazione, erano tutti silenziosi.
[Q] Erano silenziosi perché colpiti o per indifferenza? 
No, no, erano silenziosi. Questo non lo so, capisci? Così poi parlando isolatamente, quello che loro vedevano è la difficoltà enorme di questo progetto, quindi, vedevano solo il lato negativo.

Però, mi ricordo che un giovane è venuto da me a dirmi, 'Guardi, che c'è una cosa interessante che il Prof. Sinsheimer' – che era un mio collega al Caltech nei tempi passati, e che adesso era nella California del nord come presidente di un istituto che lui... che era interessato nel DNA, aveva sempre lavorato in questo campo – che lui ha organizzato un piccolo meeting appunto per questo, per vedere se è possibile arrivare a questo progetto. Perciò questo mi ha rafforzato le idee, almeno ho qualcuno che va d'accordo con me. E poi, quando ho ripetuto questo in un altro meeting, non so dove esattamente, insomma tutto questo perciò ha suscitato un po' di interesse, ma era una cosa molto limitata, per cui ho detto, 'Guarda, forse la cosa più importante è che devo scrivere un articolo sopra Science' – che è il giornale scientifico più letto che ci sia – 'per fare questo punto in modo che, dopo di quello, la gente non può più ignorarlo, devono capire se vogliono farlo o se non vogliono farlo'. E così ho scritto questo articolo che, da principio, era un po' lungo come articolo, perciò Kennedy, che era il direttore di Science, il redattore, mi ha detto, 'No, questo è troppo lungo, bisogna farlo più breve'. Dice, 'Cominciamo da questo numero ad avere una nuova rubrica che si chiama Le prospettive'. Dice, 'Perciò scrivi una prospettiva, due pagine'. Allora ho fatto questo ed è stato pubblicato. Ecco l'effetto di quello è stato enorme, perché, appunto, come dicevo, quando si pubblica, tutti lo possono leggere e tutti devono reagire in qualche modo.
Mi ricordo che Paul Berg era a un meeting a Cold Spring Harbor, non so... c'era uno di questi meeting a Cold Spring Harbor, e ha visto questo articolo proprio durante il meeting, allora ha parlato a Watson e dice, 'Guarda, questo bisogna che facciamo una speciale riunione su questo con tutti i membri già di questa riunione'. E così ha cominciato a discutere e questo è stato in fondo il principio delle discussioni sopra questo campo. Nell'insieme, le reazioni che io ricevevo nelle prime due o tre settimane erano fondamentalmente quasi tutte negative, tutti vedevano l'enorme difficoltà di fare questo però, pian pianino, entro dopo direi in meno di un mese, la situazione è cambiata completamente, perché tutti quelli che prima esitavano, erano contrari, adesso vedevano la necessità ed è così che il progetto è partito con grande velocità, veramente, perché c'era...
[Q] Però direi, che le prime reazioni negative, però se nel giro di un mese... il fermento creato da questo articolo di 'Science' è stato quello che ha portato a guardare più in fondo le cose. 
Eh, sì, certo; c'erano riunioni, cose incredibili avvenivano, perché mi ricordo c'è stata una riunione lì a Washington, all'Accademia delle Scienze, in cui io ho presentato di nuovo questo, spiegando quali sono le ragioni, i vantaggi, ecc. ecc. e poi una discussione, che tutti presentavano lati positivi, lati negativi, ecc. e c'è un genetista nella categoria-  nella gerarchia ufficiale in Italia ha una posizione permanente, perché è membro di un comitato dell'Accademia delle Scienze, insomma e lui dice, 'Ma, non capisco perché bisogna conoscere tutti i geni', dice, 'E' come se noi avessimo un albero con tante foglie e vogliamo pigliare tutte le foglie, una per una, ed esaminarle. Questo è pazzesco'. E io dico, 'Ma pensiamoci bene, le foglie di un albero sono tutte le stesse, i geni di un uomo sono tutti diversi perciò', poi non ha più detto niente.
[Q] C'è ancora questo genetista?
Sì, sì, c'è ancora. Ma insomma, così sono... e cosi' il Progetto Genoma è partito.

Then when, after some time, when I was Chairman, there was a meeting in Washington organised by the Consul... no, not the Consul, by the Italian Ambassador.
[Q] Yes, it was the famous meeting in Washington. 
In Washington, so with both American and Italian participants, and I went there and I presented this again, explaining the situation, as it was already at that time, the process was starting to progress, progress was being made. And there at this meeting, was Luigi Rossi Bernardi, who was the head of the Italian National Research Council and he came over to speak to me and said, 'If you are doing this, why don't you come to Italy, we are organising an Italian Genome Project?' 'Oh', I said, 'Okay, I'll come'. And in fact this was when... well, I came to Italy though not permanently, but temporarily, spending a few months here, etc. This Italian project was developed, but naturally given the very limited resources that we had, we had to restrict ourselves to considering particular specific aspects, to consider certain parts of... of a certain chromosome. It was a contribution, but a very limited contribution to this.
[Q] But in the project, when you launched it in Italy, in the meeting in Washington, was there not, if I'm not mistaken, also support, incentive, at that time, from Montedison in the Culture Project or not? 
No, that had nothing to do with it, he didn't participate directly in this. And so then, in the end – this project in Italy lasted five years – and at the end of five years, with things as they were going in Italy, they said that they wanted to consider it, but needed to carry out a pre-presentation, a pre-analysis, an analysis... all of which would take years. In short, in the end, after three to four years, I said, 'Look, don't think about it any more, it's not worth it, even if you wanted to before, it's far too late'  and so the idea was abandoned.
Then, I developed connections during this period with a group of researchers in Milan, who were from the National Research Council in Milan, who were interested in what I had started to work on to do with breast genes and breast cancer. In fact, we spoke about it and they said that I could continue this work here in Milan, because they had the Institute of Tumours in Milan, where they have many human cancers and where I could obtain the material to study human cancer, which in the United States it is very difficult to obtain, because in the United States, if there is a cancer sample, they want to use it all to examine something in detail. So as not to have surprises of any type, which is very... rather exaggerated, although understandable. And so I decided that it would be worth it, we started together for a little while, I worked with them.
[Q] Which was the group with Vezzoni? 
The group with Vezzoni, but there is a very good researcher, who is called Ileana Zucchi, and she is truly the one that did everything and the others were, accessories.

So, we embarked upon it, we also decided to continue to study the development in a simpler system, and the simpler system was provided by tissue cultures. We're back with the rat again, where I studied previously and there was a culture that was derived from another person and this culture was the culture that developed in many directions. And therefore I closely analysed all the various sub-types that emerged and I saw that there were a few that were really stable and in particular, there were two stable types; one, the cells were truly epithelial, are the cancer cells, the cells from the breast ducts, and the other, however, with the cells that seemed fusiform, not therefore epithelial, that had to be a type... it was difficult to say to what they corresponded, in short. But there were two stable types and then I kept these cultures. And, observing the cultures of these epithelial cells, I noted that when the cells grew in the cultures, on glass plates, the cells always became more numerous, they started to develop what we call domes, therefore they broke away from the substrate and grew forming this dome. And these domes had a structure, a completely different appearance from the other cells, therefore it was clearly a phenomenon of differentiation. I thought to myself that this was interesting, that we could use this to study differentiation; however, the mammary gland was so complex that it was difficult to try and understand everything. We started to study this and we studied the genes involved. And we did this by comparing these two cultures that I was talking about: the one that makes the domes and the other fusiform, so we obtained messengers from two types of cells and then we put one in large quantities and the other in small quantities.
[Q] So both in epithelial and in fusiform? 
Yes, we took considerable quantities of the one from the epithelial cells, and the other in small quantities and then we had the small amount absorbed by the large amounts so that what remained were only cells that were expressed in one but not in the other, do you see? Thus, we obtained a series of genes from one and from the other type of cell and using these types of genes of the epithelial cell, we managed to identify several genes that are involved in the formation of these domes.

The most important and interesting gene is a gene that is present, for example, in humans, is present in lymphocytes, certain types of lymphocytes, on the surface, so that it is a gene that controls the condition of the surface of the cells. Naturally, when these domes are formed, the surface changes because the cells strongly attach and then we have shown this. So we concentrated on this gene and it was interesting because if we take the cells that do not form domes, the protein produced by this gene, is only present in the centre of the cell, this is called Golgi Apparatus, because it is a study of the production of proteins, therefore it stays there, it doesn't move from there. If we use an inductor, which induces – we have several of them – the formation of these domes, we see that this protein now migrates outside and localises on the surface of the cells. However, you see, this accompanies the formation of domes. If this doesn't happen, the domes do not form therefore this gene has this function. It is a physiological function, nothing to do with cancer, it is only to understand the physiological function of this gene. Then we identified half a dozen genes that had both a positive and negative action, so we were obtaining a lot of data and it is enough for now...
[Q] At the same time were there experts? Or was there only you? Just this group that was doing it or were there others? 
We were concentrating on this type. There were others working on other aspects; this here was ours. We had all that we needed, the necessary knowledge, all the genes, we had built an entire background, you see.

In these studies into the development of domes, a fact emerged that appeared strange from the start, which is that if the activity of the fatty acids in the culture that are placed there to stimulate the formation of these domes is examined, you see that there is a very pronounced activity of two fatty acids, which are normal fatty acids: these are palmitic acid and miristic acid. When we discovered this it seemed strange because these two particular acids were involved. But then after studying what happens in this phenomenon of the protein of this gene, which is transferred by Golgi to the cell surface, we started to think that this is probably the reason why these fatty acids can influence the development of domes because when this protein passes, the protein is generally... it generally combines with one of these fatty acids, so that these fatty acids stimulate the formation of domes because they facilitate the transfer of the protein from Golgi to the surface. In fact, we then identified what these substances were – these proteins, these enzymes that transport the fatty acids – and we found what is involved in this transfer. We isolated it and in fact used one of these fatty acids to modify the protein. This is important because the cell surface is not uniform, it is like a mosaic and there are areas where the differences are always related to fatty acids, the surface is fundamentally made of fatty acids. Therefore, these additional fatty acids modify the surface in such a way that some proteins accumulate there and not in the other place. This is also what happens here, there is an area where all this accumulates... the protein of the specific gene for these things and this is thus a stage in the formation. Then what happens afterwards, we don't know, because we haven't delved much deeper into it.

Appunto sono una, perchè mentre si formano questi 'domes', cominciano ad agire anche geni che producono le proteine del latte, per cui si vede, questi 'domes' sono l'espressione, l'iniziale formazione degli alveoli, dove si forma il latte, capisci? Perciò è un punto cruciale per la differenziazione della ghiandola mammaria. Non siamo andati più oltre su questo campo e questi sono lavori recenti.

Ma, invece, un'altra cosa che abbiamo fatto è quella di fare un'analisi dei geni che sono espressi troppo- poco o troppo nel tumore mammario, in relazione alle ghiandole mammarie normali. Queste sono umane, eh! Lì il problema è questo: per determinare se ci sono dei geni che sono troppo espressi o poco espressi, quello che bisogna fare, bisogna avere una misura dell'attività funzionale dei geni e dell'espressione dei geni e questa misura è la quantità di RNA messaggero, corrispondente a quel gene che è presente nelle cellule. Se un gene è molto attivo, produce più RNA messaggero; se invece, è inattivo, non ne produce niente; o se è poco attivo, ne produce in piccole quantità. Per studiare questo, ci sono due mezzi a disposizione. Quello più comune e più usato da tutti è il mezzo dei cosiddetti 'microarrays', cioè sono dei quadratini di vetro o di plastica, su cui vengono depositati o, a volte, sintetizzati dei campioni di geni diversi in maniera che adesso si possono mettere essenzialmente tutti i geni umani, che sono circa 30 mila, o quasi tutti, insomma, e perciò misurare l'attività essenzialmente di tutto il genoma umano. Questo metodo è molto buono dal punto di vista è veloce, produce risultati rapidi, però ha dei difetti, perché... tutta la tecnologia per dimostrare, misurare la quantità dei messaggeri, è una tecnologia un po' approssimativa, diciamo così. Per cui è probabile... quasi certamente ci sono degli errori nella valutazione insomma. La valutazione è approssimativa, non è una valutazione assoluta.
C'è un altro metodo, invece, che è molto più preciso e viene chiamato "S.A.G.E", sono le iniziali di quattro parole. L'importanza di questo metodo è questa, che si prende il DNA, poi, in effetti, si isolano i messaggeri e si riconoscono i messaggeri per la loro sequenza. Sì,  infatti quello che succede è questo: si isolano tutti questi messaggeri, poi se ne prendono dei pezzi di otto nucleotidi e questi si mettono tutti insieme facendo dei lunghi cordoni, che poi vengono sequenziati e poi i vari messaggeri vengono riconosciuti dalla sequenza. In questo modo, è possibile, perché tu conti quante copie di questo messaggero esiste, se c'è una copia, due copie, dieci copie, così dipende... e questo metodo non ha possibilità di errore in questo campo. La possibilità di variazione esiste perché, quando un gene funziona, non è che in tutte le cellule ci sia sempre lo stesso numero di geni, di messaggeri. Questo varia la statistica, sai com'è, qualcuno un po' di più, qualcuno un po' di meno, ma insomma nell'insieme, questo è il metodo più accurato che ci sia. È un metodo molto lento e molto difficile, ma insomma però noi abbiamo deciso di usarlo.

The other important thing is that the people that carried out this type of work using Microarrays, generally used tumour samples, a piece of the tumour, thus, they take all the messengers. But this tumour is a mix of many types of cells, these are not tumour cells, they are normal cells, connective tissue, blood capillaries, molecules that infiltrate the tumour. In fact, the tumour is probably only half of what can be seen, thus already obscure, although it is possible to correct this a little, but it is something that obscures the results. And instead, therefore, we decided in collaboration with the pathologist from the National Institute of Tumours in Milan to isolate tumour cells, to isolate them one by one and the lady that carried out this work would look at them under the microscope and then isolate the cells that are characteristic of tumour cells using a small glass stick, therefore they are distinct tumour cells and there is no doubt about their origin and certainly there is no more contamination because this has been checked. However, it is necessary to collect a good number of cells, because if there are too few you can't do anything and the minimum you can use is 500 – to isolate 500 cells one at a time...
[Q] How long does it take? 
One at a time you need quite a while. But as these cells are... the tumour is above a fixed stratum on the glass. It is fixed, so it doesn't change, you can work on successive days, in order to obtain from the same sample. Then once you have these 500, you must extract the RNA, the messenger, but there are not sufficient quantities of this RNA to then use the SAGE technique that I told you about, because you need a lot more. So what you need to do is to amplify this RNA and there are...
[Q] How do you amplify it? 
There are methods of amplification that work pretty well and starting with this sample of 500 cells, the necessary quantities to use this SAGE technique can be obtained and this is checked to see if there are alterations, etc. This is looked at for certain specific genes, to see if they are represented normally after amplification and they are. Therefore, there is no danger of change, too many artefacts during multiplication. This was... we spent a lot of time on this to be certain.

Dunque, perciò, siamo riusciti a fare... naturalmente non possiamo studiare molti tumori per queste complicazioni, insomma, difficoltà e lì, all'Istituto dei Tumori, hanno potuto usare, usufruire di due tumori: uno era un tumore allo stadio – non era troppo avanzato – allo stadio di infiltrazione, ma sempre un'infiltrazione locale, proprio, perciò sarebbe il primo stadio della malignità del tumore. E poi l'altro, invece, è quello stadio finale nelle metastasi, cioè disseminazione negli organi periferici e questi venivano presi specialmente da linfonodi, perché lì è dove le metastasi si accumulano, sempre da principio nei linfonodi. Perciò abbiamo due tumori. E poi come cellule normali di controllo, esistono già delle culture di cellule normali ottenute da altri laboratori, che corrispondono esattamente alle cellule epiteliali normali e abbiamo usato, perciò, queste. Lì, pericolo di contaminazione con altri geni non c'è n'e', perché la cultura è chiaramente solo delle cellule normali. Perciò questo è stato le tre cose. Come risultati... quello che abbiamo fatto è di guardare a geni che sono sopraespressi, cioè hanno più messaggero che non le cellule normali, e quelli che sono sottoespressi, che hanno meno messaggero delle cellule normali. E abbiamo, perciò, paragonato i due tumori, uno locale e l'altro metastatico, per vedere come si comportavano nei rispetti di questi due tipi di geni. E il risultato è molto interessante perché i geni sottoespressi, che sono espressi molto meno del normale, sono gli stessi nei due tumori, sono gli stessi. Mentre, invece, i geni sopraespressi, che esistono nei due tumori, però sono diversi. Dunque, perciò, questo significava... cercando ora di riassumere, che quando il tumore inizia, all'inizio del tumore... perciò le caratteristiche che rimangono permanenti nel tumore, è che non ci sono... i geni normali della differenziazione non sono espressi.
[Q] Quando inizia? 
Quando inizia. E quando continua, si sviluppa, questo rimane sempre vero, perché i geni della differenziazione non vengono espressi, perciò il tumore è basato su cellule che non esprimono i geni della differenziazione normale. Invece, poi ci sono delle alterazioni di geni che producono sopraespressioni dei geni e questi sono diversi nei diversi tumori, perché un tumore, se semplicemente localizzato, sebbene infiltrante...  e lì questo tumore deve perciò produrre dei prodotti di un certo tipo, l'altro invece ha viaggiato già attraverso l'organismo, si è localizzato lì, ecc. perciò deve esprimere delle sostanze...
[Q] Cioè può essere un tumore di altra provenienza, di altro tipo?
No, no, sono tutti dello stesso tipo, e questo è che a uno stadio più avanzato e lo stadio più avanzato perciò, a seconda dello stadio... lo stadio, anzi, del tumore, è determinato da questi geni che si esprimono di più e questo già in parte si sapeva, perché si riconosce che ci sono molti geni che sono espressi fortemente nei tumori, specialmente, ad esempio, tutti i geni che producono queste proteine, che digeriscono le altre proteine, perciò permettono al tumore di penetrare oppure quelli che producono sostanze della superficie, che favoriscono l'attecchimento di altre cellule. Insomma, c'è un certo numero di proteine caratteristiche che... il cui ruolo si spiega, insomma, non è che sia una cosa. Perciò, insomma, questo è quello che è venuto fuori. Ora, questo può avere un significato molto importante, perché già, nello studio dei tumori umani, è stato dimostrato che molti di questi tumori – forse tutti, perlomeno – ma insomma diciamo, nei casi studiati, si osserva che ci sono delle cellule che hanno le caratteristiche delle cosiddette cellule staminali dell'organo e le cellule staminali sono quelle che poi producono le cellule differenziate, ma le cellule staminali non sono differenziate, son capaci di differenziazione se hanno stimoli adeguati, ma non sono... perciò è molto probabile che queste cellule che non hanno i geni della differenziazione, non è che li abbiano persi i geni della differenziazione, non è che forse erano cellule già differenziate che hanno perso i geni, ma è molto più probabile che erano cellule staminali che ancora non si sono differenziate e queste son quelle che danno luogo al tumore.

[Q] So, now I don't know if the question was asked because there was a lot of talk about stem cells and regarding this, what can be seen today can... the whole controversy that there is... because some countries allow it, some countries... I'm not talking about it from a political viewpoint, I'm just saying that some decisions were taken by scientists and opinions differ, but it can be a form of obscurantism to forbid types of research on stem cells. 
You see, it is important to distinguish. There are embryonal stem cells and adult stem cells. These ones are not embryonal stem cells, they are adult stem cells because each organ has its own stem cells, therefore in this case this problem, luckily, does not exist. The problem is not this; the problem, for example, which are the stem cells of the mammary glands? And now we refer again to these results that I spoke about earlier, obtained in rats, with monoclonal antibodies... that there is an entire category of cells and possibly one of these represents the stem cells, but they need to be isolated, you see, and we then need to see how they behave. It is not easy to work with adult stem cells, because, you see, stem cells usually exist... what we call a niche. This niche is formed by other cells and the influence of these other cells is to keep the stem cells there. Then every so often, it happens that there is an independent signal, whereby some stem cells multiply and leave the niche and when they leave the niche, they are influenced by all the other cells and start to differentiate themselves. So you see, to use the cell you need to identify the niche, which can be much smaller. I don't know, for example, in the skin, the niches are parts of hair, what surrounds it, hair, you see, close to the hair root. And the niche is there, the stem cells are there, therefore in the mammary gland I don't think we have any idea of where we are, you understand, so... However, we will look at these old results again to see if they give us any useful ideas.
[Q] And this is the current situation? 
Yes, current, today's situation.

[Q] And, however, the entire problem... I don't know if you want to mention it, but it seems to me that the whole problem of genome sequencing is what came first, what came afterwards. I saw, that there was an article in 'Nature' recently, where it said that Celera is now putting...
Yes, about the genome... sequencing was presented by two groups, the first – a public group, and the other a private group of the company Celera and, in fact, Celera was able to do this because there was the private group, because Celera... the means that it used was to randomly cut the genome, not in recognisable points, but... and then to put together these pieces with the others in such a way as to obtain the sequence. But, to be able to put them together, they needed something, a greater point of reference where these various pieces could be overlapped and the group produced this using bacteria... bacterial genomes, which are very large and therefore can accommodate surfaces, very large pieces of the genome. Without which they wouldn't have succeeded but, therefore, after all, combining the two technologies they progressed rapidly, which is also a good thing. Therefore, the public group... naturally the results were always available in the data banks, however the Celera group made some data available to the public and then others it sold, you had to buy it.
[Q] Well, Craig Venter is a man that... 
No, and then the fact is that increasingly more researchers realised that the public group's data was sufficient and there was no need... so now Celera abandoned... made all its data available in the public banks because basically, it would be...
[Q] And Celera is now dedicated to the production of medicines. 
How's that? Yes, now they try, yes.

The question is how... let's look at the scientist a little, at what he does and how he meets objectives, etc. Therefore, if I look at myself, and think how did I do all these things, what I see is that, every time that there was something interesting, again, that interested me, I tried to commit myself to it. So that there are all these changes, that are, in essence, a logical sequence of starting ideas that were very simple. And one thing that I would say is very important for a researcher is that he must get to the bottom of his research, try to make as much progress as possible, independent of the value that he thinks it has.
I tell you that at a certain point – I don't recall what year it was: in 1966 or 1965 – when I had already started working on the genes of the cancer virus, I was given an honorary degree from Yale University. Now, an honorary degree from Yale is no mean feat, there are only a few, and most of these honorary degrees are in recognition of people who helped the university directly, therefore this didn't apply to me. But the thing that amazed me most was their motivation because the motivation said that I was a type of modern-day Christopher Columbus, that I arrived from Europe and that I had done... brought such important innovations. Now, I say, I didn't expect this at all, because I didn't think that what I did had was an important thing. But, in fact, things had to be put into perspective at the time, for example, so, probably, in relation to the level of knowledge in the field in which I was working at that time, what I had contributed truly was very important, because it progressed from a stage of relatively little interest to a stage of a lot of movement, you see? Therefore, up to a certain point, now I understand their motivation which, at the time, seemed to me to be unbelievable. Therefore, I believe that this is an important point.

[Q] Dopo tutti questi passaggi che ci sono stati nelle tue scoperte, poi si è arrivato al Nobel, ma è stato un altro passaggio in fondo, però hai detto che il Nobel ti ha cambiato la vita. Ma ha cambiato la vita in che senso, appunto? Hai dato di più ancora all'umanità e hai sottratto qualcosa alla tua scienza oppure sei andato di pari passo?
No, certo, dal punto di vista della scienza, il Nobel mi ha fatto cambiare, perché, come dicevo ieri, quando ho preso il Nobel, ho pensato che quello che avevo fatto fino a quel momento lì era avevo lavorato sul cancro ma era un lavoro, diciamo, molto generale, cancro ai geni, valore dei geni, insomma, senza indirizzarmi a niente di specifico, specialmente senza indirizzarmi agli aspetti della malattia, del cancro come malattia umana. Ed è per questo che ho pensato allora, di mettermi a lavorare sopra il cancro del seno, per le ragioni che ho spiegato ieri e questo, appunto, questo è veramente il risultato del Premio Nobel. Se non avessi avuto il Premio, io non credo che avrei fatto quel passaggio, avrei continuato a lavorare nelle direzioni in cui ero fino allora. Insomma, tutti i passaggi, generalmente, hanno una motivazione, capisci, perché, come spiegavo anche ieri, abbastanza, insomma...

[Q] In relation to the present, which also... to how we are now and to the difficulties that there are in carrying out research, in terms of resources and the need to encourage policymakers to assign research funds, that go to the right places. In Italy we have many problems, but these also exist at European level and probably also... now also throughout the world. Do you think that appeals from people of science, such as yourself and others in other fields as well, are sufficient to motivate young people to pursue their research and not to get discouraged? 
Again, this is an extremely difficult problem, because, you see, taking the situation in Italy, the problem with the Italian situation is twofold, there are two things. I believe the main problem is that there is no acknowledgement of merit, in fact, the tradition is to have, to assign all funds, etc. to people who are part of a known structure, therefore to people who are recommended. And so, unfortunately, Italy has too ancient a tradition, you see? Being so old, all these habits have remained in place and it is difficult to change these habits, because, in fact, I look at what I have done in this field, and try for example to help the Telethon Foundation, because the Telethon Foundation had already started to have a system of acknowledgement of merit, which was very, very good, and I was part of their committee for several years and I saw that that was the system they followed. But few organisations have this, certainly not the Italian National Research Council, for example.
[Q] It seems the Italian National Research Council has disappointed you, why did it disappoint you so much. You returned with... it seemed that there was all the support, etc. and then things didn't go well? 
Precisely. No, then, for example, I remember that a few years ago, they asked me to participate in a... there were funds to be assigned for the... what is it called, the cystic thing, of the lung...
[Q] Cystic fibrosis. 
Cystic fibrosis. So we had to carry out a review and institutions from all over Italy were applying. So we examined everything and the committee, which also contained other highly proficient people, in the end, we decided who could have the funds and who not, you see? And included in the 'who not' were also some organisations from Lazio, in Rome... well, and you know, these organisations appealed to the Lazio Regional Administrative Court and the latter overturned our decision. So, you see how it works: you make science, but then politics comes along and takes over.
[Q] So, the politics of incompetents! 
You understand then? You can't do anything!

[Q] Però tu per sollecitare, certe volte, hai fatto tante cose. Pensiamo, per esempio, ti sei anche fatto vedere su una scena per fare vedere quello che bisogna fare per la ricerca... sei andato a Sanremo e hai fatto anche quella passeggiata con quel bambino... non sarei qui... te lo ricordi il nome del bambino? 
Certo, certo. Sì, queste cose le ho fatte... purtroppo non è facile avere l'occasione di fare cose di questo tipo, ma quando c'è stata l'occasione, l'ho sempre fatto. In fondo, tu hai portato due esempi che penso siano i due migliori esempi di tutto quello. È strano appunto di nuovo che per poter ottenere dei risultati in questo campo, io devo andare sul palcoscenico di Sanremo. E appunto, questo perché? Perché, se sono lì sul palcoscenico, ci saranno... non so Fazio mi ha detto, 17 milioni di persone che sentivano, che ascoltavano, che vedevano, perciò il mio messaggio si poteva diffondere, capito? Se, invece, avessi semplicemente mandato un messaggio, parlato con un giornalista, ecc., anche che il giornalista scrivesse qualche cosa, non avrebbe avuto essenzialmente niente effetto.
[Q] Non avrebbe avuto quella ricaduta, perché lì lo capiscono. Anche se tu vai a chiedere alla gente dopo i fondi... un fondo per la ricerca è un'offerta, un sostegno. Con persone come te, tu hai lanciato un messaggio e perciò quello... ma poi certo la ricerca non può vivere di quello, d'accordo però ti sei hai capito che dovevi fare anche quello. Io penso che questo sia uno degli aspetti per i quali la tua vita è cambiata dopo il Nobel, no? 
E può essere, certo! No, la questione di Sanremo è stata una cosa interessante, perché quando Fazio è venuto a chiedermi se volevo aiutarlo, così, io ci ho pensato un po', ma poi molto rapidamente ho pensato che era una cosa interessante, non l'avevo mai fatta, perciò ero pronto a farla e sono andato, capisci? Io ho sempre avuto questa tendenza. Quando c'è una cosa nuova, che mi sembra interessante, mi ci getto.

[Q] Ti ci getti anche nei progetti che ci sono da parte delle fondazioni adesso, perché sicuramente con le fondazioni non avrai certo le delusioni che hai avuto... non c'è un TAR nelle fondazioni che ostacoli e che fermi le cose. 
Sì, l'ultima cosa che ho fatto... e c'è stata la conferenza stampa proprio il giorno prima che cominciassero qui... era appunto quella questione di questo... ecco era qualche cosa importante per affrontare uno dei problemi della scienza, perché il problema della scienza, ho detto, è il mancato riconoscimento del merito. Questo è fondamentale, perché senza quello non si può far scienza. Ma, l'altro fattore molto importante è appunto questo fatto che le tecnologie cambiano continuamente e le attrezzature, in un paese come l'Italia, generalmente non seguono questi cambiamenti o perlomeno seguono a distanza, perché costano... sono molto costosi, insomma è tutto un insieme delle cose. Per cui questo sforzo della Fondazione Cariplo di cercare di aiutare la ricerca dal punto di vista tecnologico, a me pare molto importante, perché tende a solvere uno dei problemi. E son convinto anche che, date le condizioni in cui questo avviene, ci sarà riconoscimento di merito, le cose saranno fatte bene dal punto di vista di valutare chi dovrebbe avere questi fondi e chi no e qui, come dici, il TAR non può intervenire, io spero.
[Q] No, poi l'impostazione di questo programma triennale, direi, che insomma è molto rigida... c'è un bardo, c'è una commissione di valutazione e, quindi, ha avuto molta ricaduta anche in questi giorni questa presentazione, che è una cosa limitata direi alla Lombardia, però, insomma in Italia, però probabilmente se non ci sono queste cose non si va avanti.

[Q] What we say to today's young people is: do you want to further yourselves and have hope? 
But, to today's young people, look, what I said in San Remo is to try to help as much as possible in all ways. In fact, the Telethon put careers onto its programme, so that young people... I don't know, people who come from abroad, also locals who wish to develop themselves, can be helped to develop their careers, at least from a financial viewpoint, which is one of the things, in fact, this is crucial. And this is done in a very serious way, again: respecting values, respecting merits. This is important because if one does not acknowledge merit, then in the end, everyone is disheartened, there is no-one to encourage. Instead, now what I think is that young people have more opportunities than in the past, precisely on account of these various types of actions and in fact... now I don't know the exact number of those that returned to Italy, about twenty or so, twenty five...
[Q] Yes, about twenty or so, twenty five... 
And I spoke with them several times and they are satisfied, they are happy.
[Q] Are there other foundations in Italy that return that make this exchange? There was also for example that, the Armenise, the Harvard one which provides careers and brings them over with contracts, gives them the equipment, the laboratory instruments, all that they need to carry out research. 
Therefore this question now is, whether there is a sufficient number... then also to help young people to return to work in Italy, we also need to give them working conditions that are adequate, otherwise, why should they return?
[Q] Of course.

[Q] Does it bother you, that is, do you have any criticisms in general with regard to how the press report certain scientific discoveries, for example, both in Italy and abroad, or exaggerations or do you understand that it is necessary... you have heard, you feel, you understand, the requirement that a newspaper journalist has, for example, to speak to you to try to understand... but, do you find that they understand or that they give more misinformation than information in general?
No, I think that... unfortunately, a journalist is not interested in the details of science, because he doesn't have the training for this... but on the whole, in general, I find that there are, on some occasions, in some cases, things are presented well, in other cases they are presented badly. There are examples of both. I cannot really say any more about it if it is one or the other, but that it is a serious problem, because in fact scientific communication truly is a great problem.
[Q] The problem of communication, yes, and communicating to society above all. 
Sure.
[Q] And, on the other hand, a problem that, I think, that you scientists feel... 
You know, also, the position of a scientist is difficult because the majority of scientists do not know how to communicate, a scientist remains predominantly in his ivory tower, in his glass box, let's say, where he has his ideas, his words... he uses all this, you understand? And then all of a sudden the box opens and he has to speak to the public, but he can't change.
[Q] Sure, sure. So, this was also a commitment for you? 
Well, I managed... I managed to communicate, but I saw the huge difficulty because when I was president at Salk, each week I would organise a talk during late afternoon whereby a particular aspect of the work that was going on would be explained to the public. The public came, many people came, but I don't think that it was particularly successful, precisely for this reason, because the scientists that carried out the work, that had to explain it, were not able to explain it. It was too difficult for the public to grasp, you see? They were able to explain it to other scientists but not to the public.
[Q] And again, this is a difficultly that still needs to be overcome, but it's very difficult, however, this gap does need to be bridged. 
Yes, it's true.
[Q] Because people are thirsty for knowledge. People can't go into scientific detail, but if they understand something then they will seek to identify more with certain issues. 
That's true.

Per quello che riguarda le influenze che hanno agito su di me durante la mia carriera, ce ne sono parecchie. La prima, la più importante io direi, quando ero studente universitario, è stata quella del Prof. Giuseppe Levi di cui ho già parlato che accoglieva alcuni studenti promettenti nel suo laboratorio, che era... lui era professore di anatomia, ma invece il laboratorio era un laboratorio di biologia del tempo, perciò per esempio si facevano culture di tessuti, che, a quel tempo, erano veramente all'avanguardia delle cose, dove io ho imparato a fare le culture, che mi è servito poi molto. Ma non era quello specialmente, la cosa più importante del laboratorio era la personalità del Prof. Levi, che manteneva... era l'uomo che riconosceva il merito prima di tutto, per cui se tu facevi bene, ti elogiava, ma se non facevi bene, non ti incoraggiava a continuare, te lo diceva, ti diceva che dovevi cambiare, ecc. Insomma, questo perciò è una cosa per me essenziale. E credo l'influenza più importante della mia carriera è stata quella.
Poi ci sono anche altre influenze... molte influenze vengono, diciamo, così, in modo inaspettato, non so. Per esempio, io penso che una persona che ha avuto molta influenza, per ragioni impensabili, è la Rita Levi Montalcini, perché quando eravamo assieme in Italia, che lavoravamo nello stesso laboratorio, quando io mi chiedevo come fare per i geni ecc. e lei mi dice, 'Non credi che sarebbe bene che tu prendessi conoscenze in altri campi, che non sian solo nei campi della biologia, perché quello lo conosci, prendere, per esempio la chimica, la fisica?' Allora ci ho pensato ed è per quello che mi sono iscritto al corso di fisica a Torino e l'ho seguito il corso di fisica per due anni... o no, forse un anno e mezzo... prima di partire per gli Stati Uniti. E quello ha avuto una notevole importanza, perché era un nuovo modo di pensare iniettato nella biologia e, quel periodo difatti, c'erano molti fisici che erano diventati biologi e, senza dubbio, hanno contribuito molto, insomma. Non so, un'altra influenza importante è quella di Salvador Luria, per quando sono andato a Bloomington a lavorare con lui, perché lui e sua moglie mi hanno trattato proprio come se fossi il loro figlio, diciamo così, perché essendo nuovo, non conoscendo niente e loro veramente sono stati i miei genitori durante quel periodo. Lui poi anche era molto bravo e, insomma, mi ha aiutato certo a mantenermi sulla buona strada.

L'altra domanda era il futuro. Questo, il futuro... io generalmente non voglio rispondere a questa domanda, perché è una cosa molto non è prevedibile. Insomma, quando noi facciamo una scoperta... che cos'è la scoperta? È una cosa che non si capiva prima, che non si conosceva prima, perciò è scoprire l'incognito. Ma se è incognito, non puoi prevederlo e non puoi prevedere in che direzione le cose andranno, perciò è difficile dirlo. Per esempio, un esempio interessante in questo campo, in questa direzione è il seguente, che in marzo, direi, è comparso un articolo su Nature dove degli scienziati dell'Indiana, negli Stati Uniti, avevano... studiavano una piantina piccola che è molto usata per studi sperimentali nelle piante e seguivano certe caratteristiche genetiche di questa pianta e, normalmente, le caratteristiche genetiche, insomma, in generale, seguono le leggi di Mendel, che si trasmettono dai genitori ai figli in modo molto preciso, ecc. Ma loro si sono trovati di fronte a una situazione dove non seguivano le leggi di Mendel, anzi, quello che succedeva era questo che, partendo da due genitori che avevano una certa alterazione di questo particolare gene, naturalmente si aspettava che tutti i figli l'avessero, ma poi, a un certo punto, si sono accorti che le piante derivate da questo non l'avevano più e sono andati a verificare ed effettivamente le alterazioni della sequenza dei geni, che erano caratteristiche di questa, erano scomparse. E siccome non erano semplicemente una base, ma erano un po' di più non potevano essere dovuti semplicemente a una valutazione inversa, come qualche volta capita. Ora, come questo sia successo nessuno lo sa, perciò sembra, insomma la loro idea è che ci sia un sistema per cui una parte dell'informazione del gene viene messo da parte come riserva e poi, quando capita che c'è una mutazione, se questa mutazione danneggia l'organismo, che ci sia la possibilità dell'organismo di riparare la mutazione usando questa informazione, però nessuno sa cosa sia questa informazione. Hanno cercato di determinare... perciò, vedi è una cosa totalmente impensabile sulla base delle conoscenze e adesso la questione è andare a vedere cosa succede, ma il fatto di averlo trovato è una cosa che nessuno mai ci avrebbe potuto pensare. Perciò, mi rincresce, ma non posso fare previsioni sopra il futuro della scienza, perché le previsioni del futuro della scienza sono un mistero. Devono essere rivelate una per una e noi non sappiamo quali siano.
[Q] Questo è molto onesto.
