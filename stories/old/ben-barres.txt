Ben Barres (1954-2017) was Professor of Neurobiology and Developmental Biology at Stanford University. He focused his research on neuro-glial interactions in the developing central nervous system. He won many awards for his work in both research and education. Barres, a transsexual man since 1997, challenged the way he perceived women scientists to be treated differently from men scientists, based on his personal experience of such discrimination.
